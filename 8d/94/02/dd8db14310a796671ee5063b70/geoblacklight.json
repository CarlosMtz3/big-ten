The NAIP acquires digital ortho imagery during the agricultural growing seasons in the continental U.S.. A primary goal of the NAIP program is to enable availability of ortho imagery within one year of acquisition. INTENDED DISPLAY SCALE: 1:12,000; GROUND RESOLUTION: 1-Meter pixels; ACCURACY: + or - 15 MetersNOTE: This imagery is a Preliminary or NINTERIMN version of the USDA 2008 NAIP digital orthophotography. According to the USDA, NUsers should be aware that the interim compressed county mosaic may contain defects and have horizontal accuracy less than the specified tolerances. Defective imagery may be replaced within one year of image acquisition date.NFor more information: http://www.fsa.usda.gov/Internet/FSA_File/naip_2007_infosheetpdf.pdf",

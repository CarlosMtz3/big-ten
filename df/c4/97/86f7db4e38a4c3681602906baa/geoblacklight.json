"dc_description_s": "This data set is an LAZ (compressed LAS) format file containing LIDAR point cloud data. The Ozaukee AOI consists of one area encompassing the entire county. Ground Control is collected throughout the AOI for use in the processing of LiDAR data to ensure data accurately represents the ground surface. QA/QC checkpoints, (FVA and CVA - see Ground Control process step for further information) also collected throughout the AOI, are used for independent quality checks of the processed LiDAR data. LiDAR acquisition products include Pre- and Post- flight reports which contain information on the flightlines, equipment parameters, and other pertinent acquisition details. The LiDAR Point Cloud product consists of tiles of LAS points which are partially classified such that the bare earth points can be calibrated to the ground surface and tested via the independent QC to ensure the ground surface is accurately represented. The LiDAR processing product consists of LAS points which are fully classified with the bare earth points tested via the independent QC to ensure the ground surface is accurately represented.",

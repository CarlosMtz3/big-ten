This dataset represents the excepted ROS experience prior to Shale-Gas development (pre-2008). The Bureau of Forestrys ROS zones are defined as: Primitive: greater than 1,000 acres and more than 1 mile from motorized roads, trails, and railroads. Semi-Primitive: greater than 500 acres and more than 1/2 mile from motorized roads, trails, and railroads.Semi-Primitive Non-motorized: greater than 250 acres and more than 1/4 mile from motorized roads, trails, and railroads.Semi-Developed and Developed (Other Zones): No minimum size or remoteness criteria. The ROS model considers all changes. Non-shale gas related changes do affect the results of the analysis.",

"dc_description_s": "MANUFACTURED_GAS_PLANTS_IDEM_IN is a point shapefile that contains locations of manufactured gas plants (MGPs) in Indiana, provided by personnel of Indiana Department of Environmental Management, Office of Land Quality (IDEM, OLQ) as of June 4, 2009 and subsequently updated on October 20, 2009, and April 16, 2010. The data set provided by IDEM was in an ESRI geodatabase format and the feature class was named MGPs. The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile MGPs: MGPs produced gas for lighting, heating, and cooking from the 1850s to the 1940s. In addition to producing the desired product, gas, numerous toxic by-products (such as tars and purifier wastes) were often stored in subsurface structures or disposed of in the dump areas at the site. Significant amounts of contamination usually occurred at these sites due to the nature of gas production and poor housekeeping. MGPs productions decreased and were phased out in the 1940s due to the increase network of natural gas pipelines across the country. These plants were decommissioned by razing the building but leaving subsurface structures and wastes in place. There are at least 74 known former MGPs in Indiana.",

"dc_description_s": "The Maryland Artificial Reef Initiative (MARI) is a state-run initiative, managed by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, aimed at developing new fish habitats in the Chesapeake Bay by way of depositing artificial materials (such as concrete reef balls or recycled porcelain) to the bottom of designated sections of water in the Chesapeake Bay. The goal is to see an oyster population develop on the artificial materials, which can attract fish and other marine creatures to the site.Last Updated: 05/2014Feature Service Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Biota/MD_Finfish/FeatureServer/9",

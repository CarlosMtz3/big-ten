This standard is designed to ensure that lines and polygons in the DC GIS that are supposed to be coincident are identical. Common lines from the DC GIS Snapbase or vector property derived datasets shall be exactly coincident to the original source lines. For layers where topology is constructed To ensure that agency layers are compatible with District government base maps The Snapbase contains many basemap features All DC GIS data is stored and exported in Maryland State Plane coordinates NAD 83 meters. This layer contains complete theoretical address ranges. METADATA CONTENT IS IN PROCESS OF VALIDATION AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE.",

"dc_description_s": "The interim Sustainable Communities designation will continue for a transition period and local governments will have the opportunity to apply for continued designation. The term of the transition period is as follows: Existing Designated Neighborhoods will automatically become Sustainable Communities effective June 1, 2010. The designation will continue for a period of 24 months, during which time local governments will have the opportunity to apply for continued Sustainable Communities designation. Community Legacy Areas designated prior to January 1, 2008 will become Sustainable Community for 24 months after June 1, 2010. Existing Community Legacy Areas designated on or after January 1, 2008 will be considered Sustainable Communities for a period of 36 months after June 1, 2010. An application procedure is being developed for local governments to request continued Sustainable Communities designation beyond the transition period. The Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) will begin accepting applications for Sustainable Communities in the Fall of 2010. Applications for Sustainable Communities designation will be reviewed by an interagency panel led by DHCD and must be approved by the Governor's Smart Growth Subcabinet. Once approved, newly designated Sustainable Communities (those that apply after June 1, 2010) will retain their designation for a period of five years. Sustainable Communities also include designated Transit Oriented Development Zones (TOD's) and Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Zones. These areas are automatically considered Sustainable Communities effective June 1, 2010 and do not need to reapply for continued designation. The first, second, and some of the thrid and fourth rounds have been updated.Last Updated: 11/18/2015Feature Service Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/BusinessEconomy/MD_IncentiveZones/FeatureServer/6",

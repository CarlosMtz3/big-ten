The AWiFS ground resolution is 56 meters by 56 meters. The imagery was collected between the dates of 04/22/2006 and 09/08/2006. The Indiana data layer is aggregated to a reduced number of standardized categories for display purposes with the emphasis being agricultural land cover. Please note that no farmer reported data is derivable from the Cropland Data Layer.",

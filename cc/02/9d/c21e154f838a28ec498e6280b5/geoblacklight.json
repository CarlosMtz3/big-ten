"dc_description_s": "The natural landscape is a network of natural resources throughout Chester County. It is identified by streams, floodplains, and forests. These resources are essential elements of the physical environment and the foundation for the livability of all landscapes. The natural landscape serves as an overlay to all other landscapes. It does not preclude all development or agricultural operations, but indicates major areas of natural resources that should be protected or subject to limited disturbance. The Natural Landscape contains the highest concentrations of important natural resources. Appropriate low intensity land uses may develop with special precautions to address natural constraints. Conservation practices will be used to protect and restore the natural resources. The significance of the natural landscape in maintaining biodiversity of species, water recharge areas, and preserving a network of natural resources and habitats will be fully recognized and supported by both citizens and government agencies.",

For short-count sites, estimates are made by factoring a short count using seasonal and day-of-week adjustment factors.Data Coverage:The dataset covers the entire State of Michigan (state-owned) Trunkline system.Update Cycle:AADT & CAADT volumes are created and released every year.Contact:Kevin Krzeminski",

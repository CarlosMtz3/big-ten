"dc_description_s": "The purpose of the 2010 land use/land cover data set is to provide a generalized view of how developed land has changed throughout the state, primarily capturing the conversion of resource land to development and characterizing the type of development (e.g. very low density, low density, medium density or high density residential development, commercial, industrial, institutional). Urban Land Uses: 11 Low-density residential - Detached single-family/duplex dwelling units, yards and associated areas. Areas of more than 90 percent single-family/duplex dwelling units, with lot sizes of less than five acres but at least one-half acre (.2 dwelling units/acre to 2 dwelling units/acre). 12 Medium-density residential - Detached single-family/duplex, attached single-unit row housing, yards, and associated areas. Areas of more than 90 percent single-family/duplex units and attached single-unit row housing, with lot sizes of less than one-half acre but at least one-eighth acre (2 dwelling units/acre to 8 dwelling units/acre). 13 High-density residential - Attached single-unit row housing, garden apartments, high-rise apartments/condominiums, mobile home and trailer parks; areas of more than 90 percent high-density residential units, with more than 8 dwelling units per acre. 14 Commercial - Retail and wholesale services. Areas used primarily for the sale of products and services, including associated yards and parking areas. 15 Industrial - Manufacturing and industrial parks, including associated warehouses, storage yards, research laboratories, and parking areas. 16 Institutional - Elementary and secondary schools, middle schools, junior and senior high schools, public and private colleges and universities, military installations (built-up areas only, including buildings and storage, training, and similar areas), churches, medical and health facilities, correctional facilities, and government offices and facilities that are clearly separable from the surrounding land cover. 17 Extractive - Surface mining operations, including sand and gravel pits, quarries, coal surface mines, and deep coal mines. Status of activity (active vs. abandoned) is not distinguished. 18 Open urban land - Urban areas whose use does not require structures, or urban areas where non-conforming uses characterized by open land have become isolated. Included are golf courses, parks, recreation areas (except areas associated with schools or other institutions), cemeteries, and entrapped agricultural and undeveloped land within urban areas. 191 Large lot subdivision (agriculture) - Residential subdivisions with lot sizes of less than 20 acres but at least 5 acres, with a dominant land cover of open fields or pasture. 192 Large lot subdivision (forest) - Residential subdivisions with lot sizes of less than 20 acres but at least 5 acres, with a dominant land cover of deciduous, evergreen or mixed forest. Agriculture: 21 Cropland - Field crops and forage crops. 22 Pasture - Land used for pasture, both permanent and rotated; grass. 23 Orchards/vineyards/horticulture - Areas of intensively managed commercial bush and tree crops, including areas used for fruit production, vineyards, sod and seed farms, nurseries, and green houses. 24 Feeding operations - Cattle feed lots, holding lots for animals, hog feeding lots, poultry houses, and commercial fishing areas (including oyster beds). 241 Feeding operations - Cattle feed lots, holding lots for animals, hog feeding lots, poultry houses. 242 Agricultural building breeding and training facilities, storage facilities, built-up areas associated with a farmstead, small farm ponds, commercial fishing areas. 25 Row and garden crops - Intensively managed truck and vegetable farms and associated areas. Forest: 41 Deciduous forest - Forested areas in which the trees characteristically lose their leaves at the end of the growing season. Included are such species as oak, hickory, aspen, sycamore, birch, yellow poplar, elm, maple, and cypress. 42 Evergreen forest - Forested areas in which the trees are characterized by persistent foliage throughout the year. Included are such species as white pine, pond pine, hemlock, southern white cedar, and red pine. 43 Mixed forest - Forested areas in which neither deciduous nor evergreen species dominate, but in which there is a combination of both types. 44 Brush - Areas which do not produce timber or other wood products but may have cut-over timber stands, abandoned agriculture fields, or pasture. These areas are characterized by vegetation types such as sumac, vines, rose, brambles, and tree seedlings. Water: 50 Water - Rivers, waterways, reservoirs, ponds, bays, estuaries, and ocean. Wetlands: 60 Wetlands - Forested or non-forested wetlands, including tidal flats, tidal and non-tidal marshes, and upland swamps and wet areas. Barren Land: 70 Barren land 71 Beaches - Extensive shoreline areas of sand and gravel accumulation, with no vegetative cover or other land use. 72 Bare exposed rock - Areas of bedrock exposure, scarps, and other natural accumulations of rock without vegetative cover. 73 Bare ground - Areas of exposed ground caused naturally, by construction, or by other cultural processes. Transportation: 80 Transportation - Miscellaneous Transportation features not elsewhere classified.Last Updated:Feature Service Layer Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/PlanningCadastre/MD_LandUseLandCover/MapServer/1",

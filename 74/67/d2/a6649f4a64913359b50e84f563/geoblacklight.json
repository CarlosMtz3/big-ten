In coastal Maryland these data were extracted from data mapped by Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MD DNR) using Maryland's Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quads. The wetlands were photo interpreted from the photography flown for the Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quads. These were flown over a period from 1988 to 1995. Outside of coastal Maryland these data were compiled by The Nature Conservancy from other National Wetlands Inventory data developed by USFWS.Last Updated:Feature Service Layer Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/UtilityTelecom/MD_OffshoreWindEnergyPlanning/FeatureServer/5",

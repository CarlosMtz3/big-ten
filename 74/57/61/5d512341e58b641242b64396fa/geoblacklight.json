The WBD is a complete set of hydrologic units from newwatershed and subwatesheds less than 10,000 acres to entire river systems draining large hydrologic unit regions, all attributed bya standard nomenclature. Development of the Watershed Boundary Dataset started in the early 1990's and has progressed to the formatand attribution that is now being distributed. The delineation and attribution was done on a state basis using a variety of methodsand source data. Each state HU dataset has gone through an extensive quality review process to ensure accuracy and compliance tothe Federal Standard for Delineation of Hydrologic Unit Boundaries before and during submittal to USDA-NRCS National GeospatialManagement Center (NGMC).;",

"dc_description_s": "BRIDGES_SYSTEM1_INDOT_IN is a point shapefile that contains locations of all system 1 bridges in Indiana, provided by personnel of Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT), Business Information and Technology Systems, GIS Mapping. The data set provided by INDOT was in an ESRI shapefile format and was named SYS1BRIDGES. An update was received on June 26, 2012 as an ESRI file geodatabase point feature class named DOTGIS_Bridge_INDOT_IN. BRIDGES_SYSTEM1_INDOT_IN is attributed with national bridge identification (NBI) numbers. The term System 1 Bridges refers to bridges found on System 1 roads that include: Interstates, U.S. Highways, State Routes, Ramps, Institutional Roads (roads in state university properties, state hospitals, Indiana National Guard properties), and IDNR roads (roads in IDNR-owned properties maintained by INDOT). The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by INDOT for the source shapefile SYS1BRIDGES.SHP: Sys1Bridges.shp is a point shapefile that shows the location of system 1 bridges. The data was generated at a scale of 1:2,000,000.",

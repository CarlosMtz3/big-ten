"dc_description_s": "Polygons in this shapefile indicate areas in Indiana designated as non-attainment for ozone and (or) PM-2.5; or maintenance for ozone, carbon monoxide, lead, sulfur dioxide, and (or) PM-10. Non-attainment area is any area that does not meet (or that contributes to ambient air quality in a nearby area that does not meet) the national primary or secondary ambient air quality standard (NAAQ) for the pollutant. Maintenance areas are areas which were previously non-attainment (did not meet national ambient air quality (NAAQ) standards for the pollutant) but have now been designated attainment (now meeting the standards). These areas must have a maintenance plan outlining steps to maintain air quality and control measures to improve air quality that will remain in place. The maintenance plan must demonstrate continued compliance, considering projected growth, for a period of ten years. If outdoor air monitors record a violation of the standard, the maintenance plan includes a commitment to determine appropriate measures to address the cause of the violation. NAAQS are often referred to as federal health standards for outdoor air. More information on air attainment can be found from the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, Office of Air Quality, Air Attainment web site at http://www.in.gov/idem/programs/air/attainment/index.html.",

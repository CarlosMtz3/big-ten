The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event2-percent-annual-chance flood event The DFIRM Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs) The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The file is georeferenced to earth's surface using the UTM projection and coordinate system. The specifications for the horizontal control of DFIRM data files are consistent with those required for mapping at a scale of 1:12000.\u00a0Insurance applications include enforcement of the mandatory purchase requirement of the Flood Disaster Protection Act.. requires the purchase of flood insurance by property owners who are being assisted by Federal programs or by Federally supervised In addition to the identification of Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) The DFIRM Database presents the flood risk information depicted on the FIRM in a digital format suitable for use in electronic mapping applications. The DFIRM database is a subset of the Digital FIS database that serves to archive the information collected during the FIS.",

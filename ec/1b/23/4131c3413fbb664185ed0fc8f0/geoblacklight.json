All areas are ranked for sensitivity by the Sensitive Areas Taskforce, conviened by the MD Dept. of Natural Resources Water Use Committee. The dataset was created by combining the sandy beach areas compiled by MD Geologic Survey from the MD Wetland Guidance Map shoreline data and information given to staff by Mr. Jim Casey of the MD DNR Fisheries Division of the observed nesting sites.Feature Service Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Biota/MD_LivingResources/FeatureServer/2",

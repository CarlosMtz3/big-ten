"dc_description_s": "All parcels are based on the recorded\u00a0plat content or Auditor's legal description with interpretive analysis performed through the use\u00a0of coordinate geometry software. In cases where the legal descriptions are ambiguous, a check may\u00a0be made with the actual deed of record. Occasionally in these circumstances one or two legal\u00a0descriptions back in the chain of record are researched, but limits on time and resources often prevent this. When possible survey records such as road plans, certificates of survey and other\u00a0items on file in the County Surveyor's Office are used. Where lines are not defined by plan or\u00a0description, information may be digitized but this is rare. Resources are not available for making field inspections or surveys to locate parcel boundaries or ownership.\u00a0Where occurrences of gaps or overlaps are clear, they are identified. Generally gaps or overlaps\u00a0under 3 feet are removed. In cases of receding shorelines, extended lot lines are shown for small changes. (Refer to\u00a0SDLTXLIN explanation) When significant changes in water levels occur, extensions may not be\u00a0possible and may result in ambiguity. In these cases, extended ownership lines are noted as not defined and are terminated at previously known limits. Online link to metadata: https://www.co.washington.mn.us/index.aspx?NID=1606",

These Public Service Areas (PSA) are a new community based model for policing the Districts. A Police District can have up to 4 PSA's and as few as 2. There is a Police Liutenant assigned to each PSA and the idea is for cops to stay within their PSA's to get familiar with the residents and businesses and vice versa.",

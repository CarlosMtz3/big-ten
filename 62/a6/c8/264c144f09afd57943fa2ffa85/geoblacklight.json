"dc_description_s": "The centerline is a data sharing process between the State Highway Administration (SHA) and local governments. Using a common centerline allows better exchange of information about the roadway system and provides opportunities for more efficient collection of information about that roadway asset. Some centerlines were created in-house using imagery, GPS data, and SHA's HPMS database and others were received from county governments and updated in house using imagery, GPS data and SHA's HPMS. The centerline data includes annual HPMS updates/improvements.This layer has been modified from its original form.

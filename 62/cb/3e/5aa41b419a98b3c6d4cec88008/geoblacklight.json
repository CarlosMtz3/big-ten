These canals were constructed and used for transportation between 1830-1870. Canal historians have searched county courthouse records and archived state engineering reports to plot canal routes on USGS 7.5 minute quadrangles. Some portions of the canal routes are unknown and approximated as indicated in the table. In many locations canals have been filled in and covered by development. is collected only from southern Indiana border through Vigo and Marion counties.",

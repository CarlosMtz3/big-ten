A predecessor shapefile of ELECTRIC, named EFA.SHP, was obtained by the Indiana Geological Survey (IGS) from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS). The shapefile was included on a CD-ROM (titled arcHAZUS97, Eastern US) that is the product of a program referred to as HAZUS, The FEMA Tool for Estimating Earthquake Losses. The original shapefile (referred to as EFA.SHP) has been modified by personnel of the IGS. This metadata was created by personnel of IGS, using information included in the HAZUS user's manuals. Data for the predecessor shapefile was obtained from a FEMA Database (1992)(HAZUS99, Technical and User Manuals, Appendices.pdf, Appendix D, Summary of Inventory Databases).",

"dc_description_s": "The Maryland Inventory of Historic Properties is a research and documentation instrument that serves as an archive of information to further the understanding of the State's architectural, archeological, and cultural resources. To date, the MIHP is comprised of nearly 90,000 resources, composed of archaeological sites, building, structures, objects and survey districts. A Maryland Inventory form provides a description of historic resource and discusses its history, but the MIHP is not a regulatory instrument, and the determination of a resource's historic significance is not a requirement for inclusion. Maryland State law provides elsewhere for mechanisms  separate from the MIHP  giving both the State and local jurisdictions the authority to regulate appropriately designated historic resources. The Maryland Inventory should not be confused with the National Register of Historic Places, the Maryland Register of Historic Properties, or local lists of locally designated historic resources, although resources listed in all of the above categories are included in the Maryland Inventory.

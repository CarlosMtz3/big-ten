Functional classification generally is the process by which streets and highways are grouped into classes, or systems, according to the character of the service they are intended to provide year to year. This file is a subset of the Indiana Statewide Travel Demand Model, (ISTDM). The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by INDOT for the source feature class named FUNC_CLASS: Functional Class values on all highway, county and city routes. Functional Class key: 1 - Interstate 3 - Other Principal Arterial (OPA) 2 - Principal Arterial (Freeway/Exprswy) 4 - Minor Arterial 5 - Major Collector 6 - Minor Collector 7 - Local",

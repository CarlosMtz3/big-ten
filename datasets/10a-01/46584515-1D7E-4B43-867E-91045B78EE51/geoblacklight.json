  "dc_title_s": "Hillshade Image of Wisconsin, from 10-meter NED",
  "dc_description_s": "This Hillshade image is a raster representation of land elevation of Wisconsin, derived from the US Geological Survey's 10-meter National Elevation Dataset (NED). The NED is a seamless mosaic of best-available elevation data. The 7.5-minute elevation data for the conterminous United States are the primary initial source data. USGS developed processing methods to filter production artifacts in the existing data, convert to the NAD83 datum, edge-match, and fill slivers of missing data at quadrangle seams. One of the effects of the NED processing steps is a much-improved base of elevation data for calculating slope and hydrologic derivatives. The specifications for the NED 1 arc second (30 meter) and 1/3 arc second (10 meter) data are: Geographic coordinate system Horizontal datum of NAD83, except for AK which is NAD27; Vertical datum of NAVD88, except for AK which is NAVD29 Z units of meters",

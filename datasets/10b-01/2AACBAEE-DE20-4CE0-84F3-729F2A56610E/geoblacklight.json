Features contained in the data set include all known primary building points countywide and associated attributes and annotation. Building points sometimes are referred to as addresses, however these data typically represent the location of the primary addressed structure on each parcel and correspond to a site access point and driveway to the property. In the case of no buildings there may be a site access point but no corresponding building point. In the case of many primary addressed structures there will be a corresponding site access point for each structure even though they may all access the property from the same location.]",

"dc_description_s": "This is a polygon feature class showing soil associations in Illinois, from the General Soil Map of Illinois (Fehrenbacher, 1982). Created in 1984 by ESRI. A soil association is a group of related soil series that generally occur in a characteristic pattern of landscapes that have identifiable topographic features, slopes, and parent materials. The General Soil Map of Illinois (scale 1:500,000) identifies the location and extent of 50 soil association types.",

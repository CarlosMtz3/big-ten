"dc_description_s": "QA/QC checkpoints were collected by field survey throughout the AOI. These points were used for an independent (blind) quality check of the processed LiDAR data. LiDAR acquisition and processing to the Point Cloud product took place during the 2010 fall flight season. See MIP Case 11-05-2218S for further information and documentation. Processing to the fully classified dataset took place under the FY11 tasking. The deliverable consists of tiles of fully classified LAS 1.2 points. A narrative accompanies this deliverable, as well as the independent QC report, and a QA report.",

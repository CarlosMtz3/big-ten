The map is useful for the regional and statewide studies such as groundwater resource planning and geologic mapping. The data included on this map were compiled by many downhole logging and surface studies. This information was combined to revise the bedrock topography map for the entire state. Since some of the most extensive and productive aquifers in the state are located in thick glacial sediments of major buried bedrock valleys, special attention was given to data for known bedrock valleys. The revised map was published by the ISGS (Herzog et al, 1994) and much of the following text appears on the published map. The bedrock topography is shown as 50-foot (15-meter) contours of bedrock elevation above mean sea level (msl). Bedrock elevations range from less then 250 feet (76 meters) in southern Illinois to more than a 1000 feet (300 meters) in the northwestern part of the state. Several major bedrock valleys are found across the state. The greatest control for the present bedrock surface configuration was probably the preglacial surface configuration. The interpretations of bedrock topography have been modified since the 1950's. Horberg contoured his map with the philosophy that the bedrock surface map represented the preglacial topography modified by glacial erosion, which formed U-shaped valleys. The current map, showing narrow valley channels and bedrock knobs in wide channels, indicates complex preglacial and glacial erosion primarily from running water. The major valleys were formed before the minor valleys that appear as tributaries. Streams that formed during successive glaciations probably eroded to bedrock and produced the small tributary valleys to the main channels. The bedrock surface was less likely to be eroded as sediments accumulated during each successive glaciation.","[u'Herzog, B.L.. B.J. Stiff, C.A. Chenoweth, K.L. Warner, J.B. Sievering, C.

The original source for these data is http://geonames.usgs.gov. The ISGS makes them available as a convenience for Illinois data users. This is a point feature class of named places and features in Illinois. It includes place name, location, and general feature type. There are many general feature types, for example, Populated Place, Hospital, Post Office, Reservoir, Airport, Cemetery, and School. Refer to the Overview Description of the Entity and Attributes section for a complete list. The spatial reference is the Geographic Coordinate system (longitude and latitude). The GNIS metadata fails to specify a datum for the longitude/latitude values. This is not significant because the locations are extremely generalized. However, to make the data work in ArcGIS, the ISGS arbitrarily assigned the NAD83 datum to the data. The Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) is the Federal standard for geographic nomenclature. The U.S. Geological Survey developed the GNIS for the U.S. Board on Geographic Names, a Federal inter-agency body chartered by public law to maintain uniform feature name usage throughout the Government and to promulgate standard names to the public. The GNIS is the official repository of domestic geographic names data; the official vehicle for geographic names use by all departments of the Federal Government; and the source for applying geographic names to Federal electronic and printed products of all types. See http://geonames.usgs.gov for additional information. The original metadata file is included as a binary attachment to the XML version of this metadata document and also as a file named Orig_USGS_metadata.txt.

Additionally, names of buried valleys are annotated. Scale is 1:500,000. Several major bedrock valleys are found across the state. The greatest control for the present bedrock surface configuration was probably the preglacial surface configuration. Interpretations of bedrock topography have been modified since the 1950's. Horberg contoured his map with the philosophy that the bedrock surface map represented the preglacial topography modified by glacial erosion, which formed U-shaped valleys. The current map, showing narrow valley channels and bedrock knobs in wide channels, indicates complex preglacial and glacial erosion primarily from running water. The major valleys were formed before the minor valleys that appear as tributaries. Streams that formed during successive glaciations probably eroded to bedrock and produced the small tributary valleys to the main channels. The bedrock surface was less likely to be eroded as sediments accumulated during each successive glaciation.

These LAS files are processed into elevation models to create gridded rasters. The first returns can be used to map the top reflective surface (Digital Surface Models - DSM), these normally include open terrain areas, as well as the tops of buildings, trees, towers, and other features elevated above the bare earth.

The attribute data include quadrangle name and index number, longitude and latitude values for quadrangle boundaries, X and Y coordinate values in decimal degrees for quadrangle corners, and boolean indicators of which lines to use to construct index maps for common map series (by scale or extent). This feature dataset includes line and polygon feature classes for each of the following scales/extents: 3.75-minute x 3.75-minute, commonly called quarter-quadrangles, typically used for a 1:12,000-scale index, 7.5-minute x 7.5-minute, the common USGS topographic sheet extent, typically 1:24,000-scale in Illinois, 15-minute x 15-minute, typically used for 1:62,500-scale index, 30-minute x 1 degree, typically used for 1:100,000-scale index, 1-degree x 2-degree, typically used for 1:250,000-scale index. Also included are master line, polygon, and corner point (tic) templates from which the above were generated. These are entitled Base_Template_Ln, Base_Template_Py and Corner_Tic_Pt respectively, and include of all the 3.75-minute x 3.75-minute quarter-quadrangles and corners from 36 to 43 degrees north latitude and 86 to 92 west longitude, with an indication of which are within Illinois. Each boundary line is composed of segments that are 18 arc-seconds in length. To provide some reference, there are 25 such segments in a line 7.5 minutes long. These vertices are included so that on reprojection of the data into a different coordinate system the quadrangle boundaries will 'curve' to maintain a realistic representation of quadrangle shape in relation to real world coordinates. The data were generated as a mathematical construct, independent of ground condition. That is, they were generated from a digital file of decimal degree-minute-second locations for each quadrangle corner, using the ArcInfo Workstation GENERATE command. Tics were generated in this manner as well, one at each quarter-quad corner. Thus quadrangle corners are exact within ideal geographic decimal degree NAD83 coordinate space. Some non-ideal quadrangle boundaries have been added to the dataset to account for quadrangle maps with irregular boundaries, for example 15-minute quadrangles in the Chicago area. The nominal scale is as stated above for each feature class. However, these data are in fact scale-less because they are a mathematical construct independent of ground condition.

The Illinois General Assembly is composed of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The General Assembly is sometimes referred to as the Illinois Legislature or the Illinois Congress. The state is divided into representative districts (House) and legislative districts (Senate). Each legislative district is composed of two representative districts, following this pattern: representative districts 1 & 2 = legislative district 1 representative districts 3 & 4 = legislative district 2 representative districts 5 & 6 = legislative district 3 etc. The term 'congressional district' usually refers to the federal body rather than a state body.

This raster mosaic can be used in conjunction with the raster mosaics named IL_DOQ_2005_MOSAIC_UTM15_RAS and IL_CUA_2005_MOSAIC_UTM16_RAS to provide full 2005 orthophoto coverage of Illinois. The raster mosaic was constructed using uncompressed GeoTIFF images and ArcSDE 9.1 command-line functions. It is stored in the SDE database with LZ77 compression. The original image tiles were not resampled in the mosaicking process and had exact side-by-side pixel registration. This means the SDE raster layer preserves the exact pixel location and cell values of the source images. The data consume 512 gigabytes of disk space in 15,680,818 database rows. The in-processing occurred over the period 20060612 to 20060920 as the data were delivered is several lots by the USGS. [Begin excerpt from USGS metadata] A 0.5 meter resolution panchromatic (B and W) USGS Digital Orthophoto Quarter-quadrangle (DOQQ) (sic) A DOQQ is a raster image in which displacement in the image caused by sensor orientation and terrain relief has been removed. A DOQQ combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. The geographic extent of the DOQQ is equivalent to a quarter of a 7.5-minute map (3.75 minutes of latitude and longitude) with overedge . The overedge ranges from a minimum of 50 meters to 300 meters beyond the extremes of the primary and secondary corner ticks. DOQQs are produced with a 1-meter ground sample distance (GSD) and are cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection on the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). Primary (solid) and secondary (dashed) corner ticks are burned into the image to indicate the geographic corners of the DOQQ. The primary ticks always show the NAD83 corners. The secondary ticks show either the NAD27 or the local horizontal datum in use in a specific area (e.g. the Puerto Rico datum, the Hawaiian datum). Each DOQQ is produced to meet a National Map Accuracy Standard (NMAS) for 1:12000 scale maps (10.16 meters radial error at a 90% probability). Each DOQQ is formatted with a variable length ASCII header followed by a series of 8-bit image data lines. The ASCII header is padded to equal the length of one image line. The header contains information on file organization, display (samples and lines), georeferencing, and production sources. The file structure for a native format DOQQ is analogous to a raw raster BIL (panchromatic) or BIP (RGB color). DOQQs are nominally produced from National Aerial Photography Program (NAPP) source imagery flown at 20,000 feet above average ground using a single source image for each DOQQ. NAPP imagery is flown leaf-off in deciduous vegetation regions.

Digital Elevation Models (including terrain and surface models) are raster data sets created from whole LiDAR point cloud data sets (LAS files). The LAS files are the standard LiDAR file format which contains the raw point cloud data, these data are normally classified and distinguished between points on the ground, water or elevated features such as buildings, trees, towers, bridges, etc.. These LAS files are processed into elevation models to create gridded rasters. The first returns can be used to map the top reflective surface (Digital Surface Models - DSM), these normally include open terrain areas, as well as the tops of buildings, trees, towers, and other features elevated above the bare earth.

The sources of this data set were published and digitized at 1:250,000; however, the soils map and depth to aquifer map (stack-unit map) were generated from source data mapped at 1:15,000 and 1:64,000, respectively. This aquifer sensitivity map was published at 1:500,000 (statewide map), and 1:250,000 (county maps). Nominal scale is 1:250,000. Two statewide data sets were identified as containing information that would be useful for producing aquifer sensitivity maps: a soil association map (and database) and a map of geologic materials to a depth of 50 feet (Stack-unit map). The soil association map and database were used in an interpretive mapping model that generated maps of nitrate and pesticide leaching classes by examining factors that relate to water movement characteristics of the soil. The pesticide contamination sensitivity data set was created by combining the nitrate map interpretations with information on the distribution of organic matter. (Pesticides are organic compounds that tend to adsorb to soil organic matter, and so have their movement in soil water retarded.) One of the results is six nitrate and six pesticide leaching classes that group soil associations based on the relative probability of nitrate and pesticide movement through the associated soil profiles. The ranking is qualitative, and is based on the median leaching value of the soil map units that comprise each soil association. Leaching classes include: Excessive, High, Moderate, Somewhat Limited, Limited, and Very Limited. See ISGS EG 148 for the derivation of these classes. To provide a measure of leaching class variability within each association, leaching class range values were calculated. Four trimmed range values were determined for the leaching classes in each soil association to give an indication of the variability within a specific leaching class. This data set is necessary because each soil association could have only a single leaching class value assigned to it. This item was calculated by sorting the component soil series in order of their leaching characteristic within the association. The trimmed range is the domain of leaching characteristic values between the 90th and 10th quantiles in the sorted list.To reduce the impact of extreme leaching class values on this estimate, the the range values were trimmed so that the upper and lower 10% of values were not included in the calculation. These trimmed range values were used as an overprint on the published map of leaching classes (see cross reference entries). For example, a particular soil association may have pesticide leaching values that range from 'Excessive' to 'Somewhat Limited', with a median value of 'Moderate'. This soil association is assigned an overall leaching value of 'Moderate', with a range of 4 (being the values Excessive, High, Moderate, and Somewhat Limited). The ISGS statewide Stack-Unit map was used to create a map of depth to the uppermost aquifer, which was then combined with the maps of nitrate and pesticide leaching classes to ultimately derive aquifer sensitivity to contamination by nitrate and pesticide leaching. Six aquifer sensitivity classes are indicated: Excessive, High, Moderate, Somewhat limited, Limited, and Very limited. Disturbed land and surface water areas are also shown. These data are to be used in conjunction with ISGS Environmental Geology report 148.","[u'Donald A.

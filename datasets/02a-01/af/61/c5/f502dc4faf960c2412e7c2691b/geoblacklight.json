"dc_description_s": "Note: The original metadata file was written by ImageAmerica. There are a few additions by ISGS required for archival and access in the Survey's enterprise GIS. The Des Plaines images are one-foot resolution digital images which have been ortho-rectified to accuracy criteria required for use of the images at 1'=200' (1:2,400 scale). These black and white images cover approximately 450 square miles of the Des Plaines Watershed in southeastern Wisconsin and northeastern Illinois and were acquired during leaf-off vegetative conditions. The complete set of images and project index are distributed on 28 CDs. [ISGS note: and on the Illinois Natural Resources Geospatial Data Clearinghouse.]",

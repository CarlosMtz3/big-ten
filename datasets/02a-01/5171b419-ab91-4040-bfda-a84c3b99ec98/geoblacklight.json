  "dc_description_s": "This feature class shows the distribution of areas that contain one or more sinkholes throughout the state of Illinois. Areas that contain sinkholes are susceptible to aquifer contamination and may also lack the stability required for certain land-uses. Sinkholes are one of the major indicators of karst terrains. This map provides basic data for land-use planning and decision making.",

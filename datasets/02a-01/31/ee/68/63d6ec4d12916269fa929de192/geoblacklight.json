"dc_description_s": "This feature dataset contains wetlands and deepwater habitats in Illinois is of 1987 based on U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) data. This feature dataset was quickly assembled from old Arc/Info coverages to produce a general representation of the state of Illinois and has not been reviewed or quality-controlled in any way and is not supported. Attributes include NWI and IDNR identifiers and text designation of habitat. The data are in the Geographic Coordinate System, decimal degrees, NAD83. There are 13 habitat designations. Some examples are Bottomland Forest, Emergent Lake, Intermittent Riverine, Open Water Wetlands, and Swamp. More recent data may be available at the NWI web site (http://www.fws.gov/nwi/). Data are available for download at that site by 1:24,000-scale and 1:100,000-scale quadrangle. Original NWI metadata are also available there.",

  "dc_description_s": "This raster dataset consists of edge-matched USGS 1:250,000 DEM tiles for Illinois. Cell size is 301 feet and cell values are elevations in meters above mean sea level rounded to the nearest integer. The data include all of Illinois and extend approximately nine miles beyond the state boundary. Some elevation data at the edges of individual DEM tiles were smoothed to remove edge-matching faults.",

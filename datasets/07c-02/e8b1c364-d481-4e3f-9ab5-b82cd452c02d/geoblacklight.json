  "dc_description_s": "This feature dataclass was created with the intentions of displaying all of the school districts whose boundaries are located within Washtenaw County.  The boundaries were created by dissolving the current Washtenaw County parcels layer by the school district field.  In order to maintain the attributes of the old school districts file, we then lined up the boundaries from the old school districts map with the dissolved layer.  After the boundaries were lined up, topology was created in order to verify that there were no topological errors within the feature dataclass.",

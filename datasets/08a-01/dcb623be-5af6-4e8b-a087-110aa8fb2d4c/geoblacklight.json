Rights of Way and Centerlines that are currently being used for rail traffic are coded as In Use. Rights of Way and Centerlines that no longer maintain rail traffic but have tracks remaining, as exemplified by plants growing through or around the tracks or right of way, are coded as Abandoned. Rights of Way and Centerlines that have the tracks removed are coded as Old. The Rights of Way and Centerlines that have the tracks removed and have been converted to trails are coded as Rails to Trail. For rail lines that cannot be discerned between Old and Rails to Trails, the Rights of Way and Centerlines shall be coded as Old.",

The aerial Orthoimagery was collected during leaf-off conditions during the fall 2012 flying season (November) at 1=100\\ scale with a 6-inch pixel resolution. The Orthoimagery is being delivered as a project area wide dataset, consisting of 2,500\\ x 2,500\\ tiles. The file naming convention is as follows: xxxyyy (Pennsylvania North Zone); Please note that xxx and yyy represent the easting and northing coordinates (respectively) in state plane feet.

  "dc_description_s": "This raster dataset has been created using inputs including 'Networked Streams of Pennsylvania' data as originated by Environmental Resources Research Institute (see metadata entitled 'netstreams.htm', 'Pennsylvania Land Cover dated 1992' developed by the EROS Data Center for EPA Federal Region III (see metadata entitled 'Land Cover 1992 EPA Federal Region III.pdf') and small watersheds (see metadata entitled 'smallsheds.xml'). The percent of first and second order streams (Strahler method) within the small watersheds and the percent of Forest (Coniferous Forest, Mixed Forest, Deciduous Forest, and Woody Wetland) within the small watersheds were calculated. The shapefiles were then converted to Raster and reclassified into 10 quantiles as follows: 1st & 2nd Order streams: Old Value New Value 0-42 1 43-59 2 60-66 3 67-70 4 71-75 5 76-78 6 79-83 7 84-89 8 90-99 9 99-100 10 Forest: Old Value New Value 0-10 1 11-18 2 19-23 3 24-28 4 29-33 5 34-40 6 41-45 7 46-53 8 54-66 9 67-100 10 The reclassified first & second order streams and the forest were then added together and divided by 2 to maintain the 0-10 value range. Conservation values were determined by experts gathered by Natural Lands Trust through SmartConservation. This data set is one of several that have been combined to create an overall aquatic resources conservation value raster for the expanded piedmont ecoregion. Therefore the values were determined as a relative rank, comparable in value only to the other input aquatic resources data. Conservation value ranges from 1 - 10 with 10 being the highest value.",

  "dc_description_s": "This Historical North Atlantic Hurricane Tracks file of major storms with landfall in the United States contains the six-hourly (0000, 0600, 1200, 1800 UTC) center locations and intensities for all northern Atlantic major storms from 1851 through 2004. Major storms are those that made landfall in the United States and that were classified on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale as Category 3, 4, or 5 at the time of landfall. Landfalling storms are defined as those storms whose center is reported to have either crossed or passed directly adjacent to the United States coastline, and which came ashore with tropical storm intensity or greater (sustained surface winds of 34 knots or 39 miles per hour or greater). In 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003 there were no major landfalling hurricanes. This a replacement for the January 2005 map layer distributed as Historical North Atlantic Hurricane Tracks ? Major Storms with Landfall in the United States, 1851-2003.",

  "dc_description_s": "This raster dataset has been created using inputs including 'small watersheds' collected through PASDA (www.pasda.psu.edu) and 303d/305B data from Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection dated July 2009. The 303d data was assigned value based on the attainment of the stream. Attaining streams received a value of 8, unattaining streams received a value of 0, and unassessed streams received a value of 3. The average value for each small watershed was calculated by multiplying each stream segment's length by its assigned value and dividing by the total length of the streams within the watershed. The data was converted to raster and reclassified into 10 quantiles. Conservation values were determined by experts gathered by Natural Lands Trust through SmartConservation. This data set is one of several that have been combined to create an overall aquatic resources conservation value raster for the High Allegheny Plateau Ecoregion. Therefore, the values were determined as a relative rank, comparable in value only to the other input aquatic resources data. Conservation value ranges from 1 - 10 with 10 being the highest value.",

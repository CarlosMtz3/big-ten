  "dc_description_s": "Tile Index for  National Agriculture\\r\\nImagery Program (NAIP) 2010.  NAIP acquires digital ortho imagery\\r\\nduring the agricultural growing seasons in the continental U.S..\\r\\nA primary goal of the NAIP program is to enable availability of\\r\\northo imagery within one year of acquisition. NAIP provides two\\r\\nmain products: 1 meter ground sample distance (GSD) ortho\\r\\nimagery rectified to a horizontal accuracy of within +/- 3\\r\\nmeters of reference digital ortho quarter quads (DOQQs) from\\r\\nthe National Digital Ortho Program (NDOP); and, 2 meter GSD\\r\\northo imagery rectified to within +/- 10 meters of reference\\r\\nDOQQs.  The tiling format of NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75\\r\\nx 3.75 quarter quadrangle with a 300 meter buffer on all four\\r\\nsides.  NAIP quarter quads are formatted to the UTM coordinate\\r\\nsystem using NAD83.  NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10%\\r\\ncloud cover per tile.\\r\\nThis file was generated by compressing NAIP quarter quadrangle\\r\\ntiles that cover a county.  MrSID compression, with mosaic\\r\\noption, was used.  Target values for the compression ratio\\r\\nare (50:1) and compression levels(9) are used.",

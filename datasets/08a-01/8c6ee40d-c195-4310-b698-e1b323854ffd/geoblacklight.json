  "dc_description_s": "This dataset consists of classified LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) elevation points produced by the PAMAP Program.  Additional information is available at the PAMAP website: www.dcnr.state.pa.us/topogeo/pamap.PAMAP data are organized into blocks, which do not have gaps or overlaps, that represent 10,000 feet by 10,000 feet on the ground. The coordinate system for blocks in the northern half of the state is Pennsylvania State Plane North (datum:NAD83, units: feet); blocks in the southern half of the state are in Pennsylvania State Plane South. A block name is formed by concatenating the first four digits of the State Plane northing and easting defining the block\\s northwest corner, the State identifier PA, and the State Plane zone designator N or S (e.g. 45001210PAS).",

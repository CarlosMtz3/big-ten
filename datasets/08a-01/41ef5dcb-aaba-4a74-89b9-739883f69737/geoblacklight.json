For this effort, Continental Mapping Consultants (Continental) will collect and process high accuracy classified LiDAR data in .LAS format as well as a combination of raster digital elevation models.The National Guard Bureau (NGB) requires the collection and processing of high accuracy classified LiDAR data in .LAS format as well as a combination of raster digital elevation models and additional hydrographic breaklines. The data is to be acquired during the Spring 2017 timeframe, during leaf-off conditions. The acquired LiDAR data will be used for various planning, design, research and mapping purposes. The NGB requires this data collection for Fort Indiantown Gap near Lebanon, Pennsylvania.",

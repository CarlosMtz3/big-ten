  "dc_description_s": "Planimetric Coverage containing the delineation of buildings or related structure outlines that represent the footprints of these buildings. Building outlines are closed off at tile boundaries by the tile neat line. The annotation.bn layer contains some building names. Building elevations are also included as attributes for each polygon. The polygon outlines of buildings for the entire City, constructed from coverage polylines. Note: many buildings are shown as connected. This includes rowhouses that appear as a single polygon and larger buildings where a determination could not be made. The only attributes included are ID, Area, Perimeter and Feature Code (IFCODE). There are no addresses assigned to these buildings at this time.This is one of the planimetric coverages developed as part of the aerial survey project of 1996 and updated using new aerial photography collected between 25 March 2004 and 23 April 2004.Explicit elevation coordinate included with horizontal coordinates. All data compiled in Philadelphia Vertical Datum (i.e.: NAVD88 elevation minus 4.631 feet) DATA DEVELOPMENT:Sanborn's methods for capturing the building footprint included ariel imagery and the 2004 DEM.

  "dc_description_s": "This raster dataset has been created using inputs including 'small watersheds' (see metadata entitled 'smallsheds.xml') and the National elevation datasets collected through PASDA (www.pasda.psu.edu). Flow accumulation was calculated using GIS and values were assigned to the raster based on the amount number of cells flowing into each cell as follows: # of cells flowing into Value 0-2 10 2-4 9 4-22 7 22-112 5 112-1414 3 1414-2828 2 2828-5656 1 >5656 0 This was then intersected with the small watersheds and conservation value was assign to the watersheds based on the average value of the flow accumulation within the watershed. Conservation values were determined by experts gathered by Natural Lands Trust through SmartConservation. This data set is one of several that have been combined to create an overall aquatic resources conservation value raster for the Expanded Piedmont Ecoregion. Therefore, the values were determined as a relative rank, comparable in value only to the other input aquatic resources data. Conservation value ranges from 1 - 10 with 10 being the highest value.",

The aerial imagery was flown in the Fall of 2012. The aerial imagery will be acquired using a digital aerial camera sensor. The orthoimagery will be 8-bit, 4-band stacked, color digital orthoimagery at 1'=100' with a 6-inch pixel for the entire Lake Erie Drainage Basin and the MS4 area ( 512.4 square miles). The individual orthoimages will be delivered in a 2,500' x 2,500' tile grid system as GeoTIFFs and as a project-wide MrSID compressed image",

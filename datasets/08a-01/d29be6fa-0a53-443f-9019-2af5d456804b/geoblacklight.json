More than 2,000 cast aluminum markers tell the important and interesting stories that are part of the history of Pennsylvania. Nominations for historical markers may be submitted by any person or organization. New markers are approved and dedicated each year. Most markers are dedicated in public events featuring public officials, local historians, community representatives, and others. Each dedication presents opportunities for Pennsylvanians to celebrate and understand their heritage.",

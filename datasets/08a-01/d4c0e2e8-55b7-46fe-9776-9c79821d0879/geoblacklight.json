It is a result of visual interpretation of the topography of Pennsylvania as illustrated by 20-feet countour intervalls on 1:50,000 scale county-size topographic maps. There has been no field investigation or aerial photograph interpretation involved in the production of this dataset. The feature class has the attribute field called 'PHYSNO', which has been padded to 14 character length for all records.",

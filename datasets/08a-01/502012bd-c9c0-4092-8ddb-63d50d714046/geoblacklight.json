  "dc_description_s": "This dataset is a high-resolution representation of forest types for the northern section of the Delaware River Basin. Forest type was determined by integrating high-resolution tree canopy from the 2010-2011 land cover dataset with the USDA Forest Services National Forest Type Dataset (http://data.fs.usda.gov/geodataastergateway/forest_type/index.php). A customized segmentation algorithm within an object-based image analysis system was used to divide the tree canopy into homogenous polygons based on the spatial and spectral qualities in 2010-2011 National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) data. Each polygon was then assigned to the dominant forest type found in the National Forest Type Dataset.End users of this product should exercise caution when making decisions based on this dataset. The National Forest Type Dataset has known accuracy issues, and these issues are likely compounded when the data were reworked into this higher-resolution product.",

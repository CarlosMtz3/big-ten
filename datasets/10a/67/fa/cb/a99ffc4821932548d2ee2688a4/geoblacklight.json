"dc_description_s": "This Elevation Grid is a raster representation of land elevation of Wisconsin, derived from the US Geological Survey's 10-meter National Elevation Dataset (NED). The NED is a seamless mosaic of best-available elevation data. In addition to the availability of complete 7.5-minute data, USGS developed processing methods to filter production artifacts in the existing data, convert to the NAD83 datum, edge-match, and fill slivers of missing data at quadrangle seams. One of the effects of the NED processing steps is a much-improved base of elevation data for calculating slope and hydrologic derivatives. The specifications for the NED 1 arc second (30 meter) and 1/3 arc second (10 meter) data are: Geographic coordinate system Horizontal datum of NAD83, except for AK which is NAD27; Vertical datum of NAVD88, except for AK which is NAVD29 Z units of meters",

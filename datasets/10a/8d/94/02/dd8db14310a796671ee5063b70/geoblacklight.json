INTENDED DISPLAY SCALE: 1:12,000; GROUND RESOLUTION: 1-Meter pixels; ACCURACY: + or - 15 MetersNOTE: This imagery is a Preliminary or 'INTERIM' version of the USDA 2008 NAIP digital orthophotography. According to the USDA, 'Users should be aware that the interim compressed county mosaic may contain defects and have horizontal accuracy less than the specified tolerances. Defective imagery may be replaced within one year of image acquisition date.'For more information: http://www.fsa.usda.gov/Internet/FSA_File/naip_2007_infosheetpdf.pdf",

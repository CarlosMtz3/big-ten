Flights occurred in the Spring of 2010 for the entire State of Wisconsin, resulting in a 'leaf-off' aerial photo product. Re-flights were necessary for the eastern 4 mi of Columbia Co., parts of NW Oconto Co, and the south half of Lincoln Co. during the spring of 2011. Please refer to http://www.ncwrpc.org/WROC/Delivery_Specs.pdf for WROC program information",

"dc_description_s": "Ayres Associates was contracted through the NCWRPC for the creation of 18' RGB DOQQs from the native resolution digital orthophotography from the 2010 Wisconsin Regional Orthoimagery Consortium (WROC) imagery program. Flights occurred in the Spring of 2010 for the entire State of Wisconsin, resulting in a 'leaf-off' aerial photo product. Re-flights were necessary for the eastern 4 mi of Columbia Co., parts of NW Oconto Co, and the south half of Lincoln Co. during the spring of 2011. Please refer to http://www.ncwrpc.org/WROC/Delivery_Specs.pdf for WROC program information",

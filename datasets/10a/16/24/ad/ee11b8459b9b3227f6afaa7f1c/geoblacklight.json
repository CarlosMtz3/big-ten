"dc_description_s": "Tax Law POINT is a generalized point representation of lands enrolled in the Managed Forest and Forest Crop Law Programs, collectively referred to as Tax Law Layers. Points are located at the center point of each 40-acre quarter-quarter section in which land is enrolled. Acreage enrolled from fractional or government lots are located either to the most approximate QQ, Q or S as possible. (Enrolled parcels are represented by the PLSS shape they lie within; however, the actual size of the enrolled property may be as small as 10 acres.)",

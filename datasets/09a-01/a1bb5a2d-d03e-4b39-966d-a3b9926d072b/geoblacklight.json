  "dc_description_s": "FUNCTIONAL_CLASS_INDOTMODEL_IN is a line shapefile that shows the Federal Highway Administration functional classification of roadways from the Road Inventory of the Indiana GIS Department of Transportation (INDOT). The data were derived from pre-existing INDOT basemaps and databases. Functional classification generally is the process by which streets and highways are grouped into classes, or systems, according to the character of the service they are intended to provide year to year. Classifications are \"Interstate,\" \"Principal Arterial - Other Freeways or Expressways,\" \"Principal Arterial - Other,\" \"Principal Arterial,\" \"Minor Arterial,\" \"Major Collector,\" \"Minor Collector,\" and \"Local.\" The data were collected between 2011 and 2015.",

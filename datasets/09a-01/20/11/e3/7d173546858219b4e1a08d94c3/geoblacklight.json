"dc_description_s": "MILE_MARKERS_SYSTEM1_INDOT_IN is a point shapefile that contains locations of all mile-markers on System 1 roads in Indiana, provided by personnel of Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT), Business Information and Technology Systems, GIS Mapping. The source data provided by INDOT was an ESRI point feature class (in a file geodataase) named DOTGIS_Ref_Post_Exor. MILE_MARKERS_SYSTEM1_INDOT_IN is attributed with route numbers, and mile-marker post numbers. On November 8, 2012 mile-markers for the extension of Interstate 69 (I-69) were added to these data. The term System 1 Roads refers to all roads found in the System 1 road network that include: interstates, U.S. highways, state routes, ramps, institutional roads (roads in state university properties, state hospitals, Indiana National Guard properties), and IDNR roads (roads contained within properties owned by IDRN and maintained by INDOT). The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by INDOT for the source shapefile STATEREFPOST.SHP: StateRefPost.shp is a Point Layer, at one mile increments on all system one roads",

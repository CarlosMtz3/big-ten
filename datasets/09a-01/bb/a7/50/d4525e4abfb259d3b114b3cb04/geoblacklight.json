"dc_description_s": "The following is excerpted from an Adobe Acrobat PDF document produced by the U.S. Census Bureau pertaining to Minor Civil Divisions (MCD's): Minor Civil Divisions (MCDs)/Census County Divisions (CCds). MCDs are legally defined county subdivisions, such as towns and townships. In 21 states where MCDs do not exist or are not adequate for reporting subcounty statistics, the Census Bureau, in cooperation with state and local officials, delineates county subdivisions known as Census County Divisions. NOTE: Indiana does have MCDs, which are representative of civil townships.",

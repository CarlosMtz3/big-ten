Attributes include the name of the feature (as listed on the paper source maps), a citation to which paper source source map contained the feature, as well as an indicatior of structural movement of each feature. The paper source maps used to construct these data have scales that range from 1:12,000 to 1:500,000 (only one fault trace) with the majority being taken from sources with a scale of 1:63,360 or larger.",

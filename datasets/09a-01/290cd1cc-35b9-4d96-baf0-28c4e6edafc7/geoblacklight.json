  "dc_description_s": "PETROLEUM_WELLS_IGS_IN.SHP is an ESRI ArcGIS point shapefile of locations of all known petroleum test wells in Indiana as of January 8, 2015, as contained in the Indiana Geological Survey's Petroleum Well Database. The IGS has limited the attribute information contained in these data to the following; well identification numbers, total well depth, well type symbols (well description), and the oil/gas field names. If users require more detailed information regarding well record tables or petroleum field production histories please visit the IGS Petroleum Database Management System (PDMS): ( http://igs.indiana.edu/PDMS/ ).  The PDMS Web site is comprised of an interactive map that offers users the ability to examine and build customized maps, query data, and interactively link to a \"Table Viewer,\" where detailed tables provide well header and event information, as well as production histories, etc. The PDMS is a subscription-based Web site, where users can choose to view petroluem records and maps at no cost using the \"Basic Subscription\" option. The PDMS \"Premium Subscription\" option does charge a fee, but adds even more value to well records, reports, logs, and geological interpretations related to a well. It also allows for more efficient access to data from multiple wells during a single user session. If users require more detailed information regarding well record tables or petroleum field production histories please visit the IGS Petroleum Database Management System (PDMS): ( http://igs.indiana.edu/PDMS/ ).",

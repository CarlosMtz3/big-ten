"dc_description_s": "POLICE_STATIONS_MHMP_IN.SHP is a point shapefile that shows police station facilities in Indiana. POLICE_STATIONS_MHMP_IN.SHP was derived from the shapefile named HZPOLICESTATION.SHP, which was provided to IGS personnel by personnel of The Polis Center. This data set was derived by The Polis Center as part of several DMA2000 Multi-Hazard Mitigation Planning (MHMP) projects, from data of the Hazards U.S. Multi-Hazards (Hazus-MH MR1, v 1.1) program (data from 2003) developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). This data set is more complete in many counties in Indiana than the data set for essential facilities provided by FEMA with the Hazus-MH software. For more information on Hazus-MH, please see the following Web site: http://www.fema.gov/plan/prevent/hazus/hz_overview.shtm The following is excerpted from metadata supplied by The Polis Center for the source shapefile named HZPOLICESTATION.SHP: The original Hazus-MH data from 2003 has been updated for sixty seven counties as part of the DMA2000 Multi- Hazard Mitigation Planning process. Local jurisdiction planning teams provided updated police station location and attribute information to the Polis Center at IUPUI. The Polis Center used available aerial photography to place or adjust the locations of the facilities on top of the building rooftops.",

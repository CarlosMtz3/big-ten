  "dc_title_s": "Mean Wind Speed at Height of 100 Meters above Ground, Derived from Mesoscale Atmospheric Simulation System and WindMap: Indiana",
  "dc_description_s": "The following is excerpted from an unpublished report by Michael Brower (2004):  \"Using the MesoMap system, TrueWind has produced maps of mean wind speed in Indiana for heights of 30, 50, 70, and 100 m above ground, as well as a map of wind power at 50 m. TrueWind has also produced data files of the predicted wind speed frequency distribution and speed and energy by direction. The maps and data files are provided on a CD with the ArcReader software, which will enable users to view, print, copy, and query the maps and wind rose data.  \"The MesoMap system consists of an integrated set of atmospheric simulation models, databases, and computers and storage systems. At the core of MesoMap is MASS (Mesoscale Atmospheric Simulation System), a numerical weather model, which simulates the physics of the atmosphere. MASS is coupled to a simpler wind flow model, WindMap, which is used to refine the spatial resolution of MASS and account for localized effects of terrain and surface roughness. MASS simulates weather conditions over a region for 366 historical days randomly selected from a 15-year period. When the runs are finished, the results are input into WindMap. In this project, the MASS model was run on a grid spacing of 1.7 km and WindMap on a grid spacing of 200 m.  \"The wind maps show that the best wind resource in Indiana is found in the northcentral part of the state. The mean wind speed at 50 m height between Indianapolis, Kokomo, and Lafayette, and to the northwest of Lafayette, is predicted to be in the range of 6.5 to 7 m/s, and the mean wind power is predicted to be about 250 to 350 W/m2, or NREL class 2 to 3. In the rest of northern Indiana, the wind speed tends to be around 0.5 m/s lower, and the wind power is a solid class 2. In southern Indiana, a wind speed of 4.5 to 6 m/s and a wind power class of 1 to 2 prevails. The main reason for this wind resource distribution pattern is that the land is much more forested in the southern half of the state than in the northern half. Topography also plays a role, as does the track of the jet stream.\"",

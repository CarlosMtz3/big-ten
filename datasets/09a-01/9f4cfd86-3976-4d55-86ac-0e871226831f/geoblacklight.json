  "dc_description_s": "WASTE_INDUSTRIAL_IDEM_IN is a point shapefile that contains industrial waste site locations in Indiana, provided by personnel of Indiana Department of Environmental Management, Office of Land Quality (IDEM, OLQ) as of August 16, 2002 and subsequently updated on January 14, 2003, July 11, 2003, June 3, 2004, January 4, 2005, April 25, 2005, July 27, 2006, January 24, 2007, June 4, 2009, April 16, 2010, June 25, 2013, and February 25, 2015. The data set provided by IDEM was in an Esri geodatabase format and the feature class was named INDUSTRIAL_WASTE. WASTE_INDUSTRIAL_IDEM_IN is attributed with facility identification numbers, federal identification numbers, and addresses. Facility information and locational coordinates for state programs were provided by the Industrial Waste Section, Compliance and Response Branch, Office of Land Quality, Indiana Department of Environmental Management.  The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source feature class INDUSTRIAL_WASTE:  \"This project is the first phase in the creation of a base locational data set to establish Geographic Information Systems as an intergral part of data management for the Indiana Department of Environmental Management.  This set consists of known sites with Industrial Waste. Industrial Waste Compliance GPS Points locate the entrance to facilities that generate and/or manage hazardous waste, non-hazardous industrial waste, and solid waste. The majority of the points collected are Large Quantity Generators (LQGs). Treatment Storage and Disposal facilities (TSDs) are also being collected. Occasionally, a Small Quantity Generator (SQG) or Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generator (CESQG) GPS points may be collected if the location has significant environmental issues.  GPS data is collected, with portable GPS equipment, by Industrial Waste Compliance staff during scheduled compliance Inspections. GPS points may also be logged at nearby LQGs when the compliance inspector is conducting other compliance work in the area.  TSD - Treatment Storage and Disposal Facility is a facility that may treat, store, and /or dispose hazardous waste. The facility is usually also a generator of hazardous waste.  LQG - Large Quantity Generator is a facility that generates more than 1,000 Kilograms (2,200lbs.) of hazardous waste per month.  SQG - Small Quantity Generator is a facility that generates less than 1,000 Kilograms (2,000 lbs.) but more than 100 Kilograms (220 lbs.) of hazardous waste per month.  CESQG - Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generator is a facility that generates less than 100 Kilograms (220 lbs.) of hazardous waste per month.  Industrial Waste site inspectors were trained in techniques and proper use of Global Positioning Systems.  Trained staff then went into the field and collected GPS information at managed sites.  This information was then brought back to the office, processed, and QA/QC'd before being deposited in a central archive.\"",

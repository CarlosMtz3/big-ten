  "dc_description_s": "WASTE_DISPOSAL_STORAGE_HANDLING_IDEM_IN is a point shapefile that contains waste site locations for the disposal, storage, and handling of solid and hazardous waste in Indiana. It was provided by personnel of Indiana Department of Environmental Management, Office of Land Quality (IDEM, OLQ) as of June 25, 2013 and subsequently updated on February 25, 2015. The data set provided by IDEM was in an Esri geodatabase format, and the feature class was named WasteD_S_H_SWHW. WASTE_DISPOSAL_STORAGE_HANDLING_IDEM_IN is attributed with facility identifications, federal identification numbers, IDEM managing program and sub-program codes, and site names. Facility information and locational coordinates for state programs were provided by the Solid Waste Compliance Section, Office of Land Quality, Indiana Department of Environmental Management.  The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile named WasteD_S_H_SWHW:  \"This project is the first phase in the creation of a base locational data set to establish Geographic Information Systems as an integral part of Solid Waste facilities for the Indiana Department of Environmental Management. Inspectors and Environmental Project Managers were trained in techniques and proper use of Global Positioning Systems.  Solid Waste Complicance Inspectors then went into the field and collected GPS information at managed sites as part of the daily inspection/management of Solid Waste sites.  This information was then brought back to the office, processed, and QA/AC'd before being deposited in a central archive.  The data set also includes address-matched and map-interpolated locations.  These are being upgraded to GPS locations as time allows.\"",

  "dc_description_s": "CONTOURS_24K_USGS_IN.GDB is an Esri File Geodatabase containing elevation contours produced at a scale of 1:24,000, grouped into three line feature classes named \"Contours_24K_Hardlines,\" \"Contours_24K_Major_50Ft,\" and \"Contours_24K_Minor.\" Annotation feature classes (\"Anno_16K\" and \"Anno_3_10\") are also present to aid the user in labeling the contour data inside GIS software. Elevation values are in feet.  The following is extracted from metadata of the United States Geological Survey for the original DLGs:  \"Digital line graph (DLG) data are digital representations of cartographic information. DLGs of map features are converted to digital form from maps and related sources... All DLG data distributed by the USGS are DLG - Level 3 (DLG-3), which means the data contain a full range of attribute codes, have full topological structuring, and have passed certain quality-control checks.\"",

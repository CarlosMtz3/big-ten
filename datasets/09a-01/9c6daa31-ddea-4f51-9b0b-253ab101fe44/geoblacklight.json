  "dc_description_s": "LANDSAT_IMAGERY_INDEX_IN.SHP is an Esri polygon shapefile that provides access to the Landsat satellite imagery collected and processed by IndianaView over the past 30 years in Indiana and are organized by county. The archived imagery is available for download in GeoTIFF format with a WGS 1984 UTM Zone 16 projection (Landsat5 images are approximately 16 Mb and include six or seven bands, Landsat8 images are approximately 45 Mb and include ten bands of data, both at 30-meter resolution), clipped from the original full scene to fully encompass the county boundary. The archives are maintained and hosted by personnel of Purdue Terrestrial Observatory, Purdue University, as part of the project website named \"IndianaView\" (http://www.indianaview.org/). Attributes include county name, a website URL that links to each county-based satellite imagery archive on the IndianaView website, image counts, and a listing of all dates (and type of satellite sensor used) of image capture.",

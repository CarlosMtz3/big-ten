It includes natural and recreation areas which are owned or managed by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, federal agencies, local agencies, and non-profit organizations. It also includes private lands with Conservation Easements owned by IDNR.  \"NATURAL AREAS THAT ARE NOT OWNED NOR MANAGED BY DNR ARE ADDED AS DATA IS AVAILABLE. IT IS BY NO MEANS A COMPLETE AND COMPREHENSIVE DATASET FOR ALL SUCH AREAS IN THE STATE.  \"The Indiana Natural Heritage Data Center Managed Area Database is a digital, geospatial file containing information on Indiana's significant protected natural areas. All counties in the state are represented.\"",

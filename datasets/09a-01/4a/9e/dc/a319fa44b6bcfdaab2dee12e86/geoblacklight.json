"dc_description_s": "The layer was created to visually represent, as accurately as possible, the electric service territories served by the regulated electric service providers in the state of Indiana, pursuant to Cause Number 42868 (Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission) to establish an online GIS mapping environment to house, edit, and display visual interpretations or electric service territory rulings filed before and ruled by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. The data represented in this layer is strictly a visual aide and a best interpretation of the legally approved Electric Service Territories as ruled by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC). These data are not legally binding or necessarily fully representative of the legal rulings. These data were provided by personnel of the IURC on May 21, 2007, and subsequently updated on February 19, 2014, June 11, 2014, August 6, 2014, and April 14, 2015.",

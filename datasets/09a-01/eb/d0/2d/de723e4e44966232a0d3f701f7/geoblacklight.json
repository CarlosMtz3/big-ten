"dc_description_s": "COAL_AVAILABILITY_DANVILLE_IN_THICKNESS is a polygon shapefile giving thickness (in feet) of the Danville Coal Member in Indiana. COAL_AVAILABILITY_DANVILLE_IN_THICKNESS was extracted from COAL_AVAILABILITY_DANVILLE_IN. COAL_AVAILABILITY_DANVILLE_IN identifies those resources of the Danville Coal Member in Indiana which have favorable geologic and land use characteristics for surface and underground mining, as well as those which have unfavorable geologic and land use characteristics for surface and underground mining. In addition, COAL_AVAILABILITY_DANVILLE_IN describes the geology of the Danville Coal, including coal thickness, coal depth, and stripping ratio.",

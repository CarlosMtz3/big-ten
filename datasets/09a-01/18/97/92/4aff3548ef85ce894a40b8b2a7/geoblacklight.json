"dc_description_s": "LIBRARIES_ISL_IN is a point shapefile showing the locations of 528 libraries included in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets that are downloadable from the Web page named Public Library Directory Information of the Indiana State Library (ISL) (http://www.statelib.lib.in.us/www/isl/ldo/pldir/pldir06.html). The spreadsheets used included 06acadlib.xls (academic libraries), plmail2006.xls (public libraries), and plbranch2006.xls (public branch libraries). Using street addresses from the downloaded spreadsheets, shapefiles were created using the Geocoding tool in ESRI ArcMap 9.2 and street information licensed from Tele Atlas, Dynamap/2000, v. 17.0. The shapefiles were then merged using the Merge tool in ESRI ArcToolbox.",

"dc_description_s": "WATERSHEDS_HUC14_SUBWATERSHEDS_USGS_IN is a polygon shapefile showing the boundaries of subwatersheds in Indiana. Subwatersheds are noted by a 14-digit hydrologic unit (HUC). Actual hydrologic units often extend beyond the state and county boundaries. USGS metadata states - The U.S. Geological Survey, Water Resources Division, Indiana District (USGS), in cooperation with the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, and the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, has created a digital dataset of 14-digit hydrologic units (HU's) for the State of Indiana. The 14-digit HU's are subdivisions of the 8-digit Hydrologic-Unit Maps published by the U.S. Geological Survey Office of Water Data Coordination (Seaber, P.R., Kapinos, F.P., and Knapp, G.L., 1987, Hydrologic-unit maps: U.S. Geological Survey Water Supply Paper 2294, p. 1-13).",

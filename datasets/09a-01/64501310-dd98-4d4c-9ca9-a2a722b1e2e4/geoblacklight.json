  "dc_description_s": "WATER_BALANCE_NETWORK_IN.SHP is a point shapefile that shows the locations of thirteen meteorological, soil-water, and groundwater monitoring stations maintained by personnel of the Center for Geospatial Data Analysis, Indiana Geological & Water Survey (IGS). Each of the monitoring stations has been located in a unique hydrogeologic setting in Indiana. Meteorological sensors include tipping bucket rain gages, air temperature and relative humidity sensors, pyranometers and net radiometers (used to measure natural solar radiation fluxes), and anemometers. Unsaturated-zone instrumentation is installed at nine of the glaciated terrain sites and includes soil-moisture and temperature sensors (at most sites, located at depths of one foot to six feet below the ground surface). Monitoring wells are also installed with pressure transducers to track shallow water-table fluctuations at stations where soil-moisture sensors are installed. The data that are collected provide essential information for expanding the understanding of soil moisture and climate interactions. Attributes include station names, soil texture, soil parent material, landscape description, vegetation, and a Website URL that allows users to access real-time water-balance data for each individual monitoring station.",

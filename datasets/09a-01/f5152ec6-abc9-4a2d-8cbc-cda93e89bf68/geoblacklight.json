  "dc_description_s": "A data set showing the locations of religious centers and places of worship in Indiana. The base file for this effort was the USGS Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) data for churches current to 20070125. In 2001, BLA ground truthed churches in the current GNIS data for a large area in southern Indiana. Many locations were added. These locations were checked against the new 2007 GNIS data for duplicates, and were added to the dataset. In order to find additional locations and locations for facilities for non-Christian religions, the internet was searched for lists of locations for various religions.  Addresses found were located using Google Maps <http://maps.google.com/> and plotted in GIS using aerials.",

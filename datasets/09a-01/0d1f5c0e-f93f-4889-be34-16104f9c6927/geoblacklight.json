  "dc_description_s": "Aquifer_Sensitivity_Near_Surface_IN is a raster data layer that displays a reclassified raster data layer of estimated rates of diffuse groundwater recharge to the water table in shallow aquifers in Indiana (see Aquifer_Recharge_Near_Surface_IN). The goal of this project was to use an objective, reproducible methodology to rank aquifer sensitivity in shallow aquifers based on estimates of diffuse groundwater recharge rates. To achieve the aquifer sensitivity ranking, the groundwater recharge rates were classified by standard deviation, and the classifications were then compared to databases of contaminants in groundwater to validate the classification.",

  "dc_description_s": "EMERGENCY_HAZUS_IN is a point shapefile that shows locations of emergency facilities in Indiana.  A predecessor shapefile, named \"EFEMERG,\" was obtained by the Indiana Geological Survey (IGS) from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS). EFEMERG was included on a CD-ROM (titled \"HAZUS99, Central US\") that is the product of a program referred to as \"HAZUS, The FEMA Tool for Estimating Earthquake Losses.\" The original shapefile has been modified by personnel of the IGS. This metadata was created by personnel of IGS, using information included in the HAZUS user's manuals. Data for the predecessor shapefile was obtained from a FEMA Database (1996) (HAZUS99, Technical and User Manuals, Appendices.pdf, Appendix D, Summary of Inventory Databases).",

"dc_description_s": "COAL_UND, the predecessor of COAL_MINE_UNDERGROUND_IN, is a polygon-based ESRI ArcView shapefile that shows the location and extent of underground coal mines in the coal region of west-central and southwestern Indiana. COAL_UND includes locations for all documented underground mines that operated in Indiana since the late 1800s. COAL_MINE_UNDERGROUND_IN is attributed to allow the mine polygons to be differentiated based on mine type, mine number, source information, and dates of mining.",

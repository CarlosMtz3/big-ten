The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile named UST_SITES: The Underground Storage Tank (UST) program is responsible for registering all regulated underground storage tanks and assures that all regulated underground storage tanks meet Indiana's requirements for release detection, spill and overflow prevention and corrosion protection, and to insure that tanks not meeting those requirements are properly closed. The UST program also assures that these protection systems are operated and maintained properly. Regulated underground storage tanks are those USTs that have 10% or more of the tank and piping buried beneath the ground and contain a regulated substance, which includes either petroleum products or hazardous substances. Trained staff then went into the field and collected GPS information at managed sites as part of the daily inspection/management process.

These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979). Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of 'farmed wetlands' as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition. Contact the Service's Regional Wetland Coordinator for additional information on what types of farmed wetlands are included on wetland maps.

330d4960-e454-4587-8d04-8ed1240a431a,"Predicted Responses of Geologic Materials to Seismically Induced Ground Shaking: Indiana, 2011","SEISMIC_SHAKING_PREDICTED_RESPONSE_RP35_IN is a polygon shapefile that shows the distribution and classification of National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) soil types. This shapefile represents the first attempt to assign reasonable NEHRP soil classifications to the geologic materials throughout Indiana. The NEHRP soil classifications are based on geologic and engineering response to earthquake-induced ground shaking. NEHRP links the physical properties of soils, such as shear strength and effect on shear-wave velocity propagation, to ensure a uniform classification for nonlithified materials in the context of their performance when subjected to seismically induced ground shaking. Ranked A through F, the correct NEHRP soil class is best determined from the average shear-wave velocity of the soil column. Attributes include the following NEHRP soil classes (Hill and Foshee, 2008, Table 1, p. 5): A - Hard rock; average shear-wave velocity greater than 1,500 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 0.08. Note that Class A is not present in Indiana. B - Rock; average shear-wave velocity 760 to 1,500 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.0. C - Hard and (or) stiff to very stiff soils, including most gravel; average shear-wave velocity 360 to 760 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.1 to 1.2. D - Sands, silts, and (or) stiff to very stiff clays, and some gravel; average shear-wave velocity 180 to 360 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.2 to 1.6. E - Small to moderate thickness (10 to 50 feet), soft to medium-stiff clay, plasticity index greater than 20, moisture greater than 40 percent; average shear-wave velocity is less than 180 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.2 to 2.5. F - Soils vulnerable to potential failure or collapse under seismic loading, including liquifiable soils, quick and sensitive clays, and collapsible, weakly cemented soils; average shear-wave velocity is not applicable; amplification factor is not applicable. The following is excerpted from Indiana Geological Survey Report of Progress 35: The distribution and classification of soil types are essential to understanding the response of geologic materials to ground shaking induced by earthquakes. Thirty-seven shear-wave velocities were measured in soft sediments at various localities throughout Indiana, twenty-eight sites of which were measured using downhole methods in freshly augered and cased wells. Purdue University provided eight additional shear-wave profiles from eight sites in their Agricultural Centers; also included is a profile from one other site in Vanderburgh County. These data, coupled with the thickness of the unconsolidated materials, were used to determine the potential amplification of earthquake-induced ground shaking. This report begins the process of defining the response of geologic materials to ground shaking induced by an earthquake having an epicenter within Indiana or nearby states. It is intended to be a tool to enhance the performance of the computer program HAZUS, developed by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency to model the effects of earthquakes and to assess damage scenarios. Plate 1 of this report, a map of Indiana at a scale of 1:500,000 showing the predicted response of geologic materials to seismically induced ground shaking, is intended only for regional planning purposes and is not a substitute for on-site shear-wave measurements and geotechnical data. Continued field work is anticipated, the results of which will enhance the accuracy and value of the map.","[u'Denver Harper (GIS compiler', u'John Hill (Data compiler)', u'Indiana Geological Survey', u'Kim Sowder (GIS compiler)', u'Chris Dintaman (GIS compiler)']",[u'Indiana Geological Survey'],Public,Purdue,"{""http://schema.org/downloadUrl"":""http://maps.indiana.edu/download/Geology/Seismic_Shaking_Materials_Response.zip"",""urn:x-esri:serviceType:ArcGIS#DynamicMapLayer"":""https://maps.indiana.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Geology/Seismic_Shaking_Materials_Response/MapServer"",""http://schema.org/url"":""http://maps.indiana.edu/layerGallery.html"",""http://www.isotc211.org/schemas/2005/gmd/"":""http://64.90.181.107/geonetwork/srv/api/records/330d4960-e454-4587-8d04-8ed1240a431a/formatters/xml""}",,330d4960-e454-4587-8d04-8ed1240a431a,Polygon,2017-12-27T20:51:14Z,Shapefile,English,Dataset,"[u'Geoscientific Information', u'Geology']",IndianaMAP,3/21/11,2008,"[u'Indiana, United States']","ENVELOPE(-88.1607, -84.6882, 41.7753, 37.7554)","39.76535,-86.42445",2011

These reports included maps showing elevation of the Colchester Coal Member (Linton Formation, Pennsylvanian). The elevation maps were based on coal-test records and interpretations of geophysical logs and mine-map notations that are included in the files of the Indiana Geological Survey. Data points were plotted by coal geologists of the Indiana Geological Survey and elevation contours were drawn by hand. The original work maps were compiled at a scale of 0.5 inch = 1 mile (1:126,720.) Following completion of the investigations, the work maps showing elevation contours were subsequently scanned and digitized, and the resulting county coverages were then compiled into a single multi-county coverage. Elevations are given in feet, and the contour interval is 20 feet. Since the completion of this shapefile, additional data on coalbed elevations in selected areas have been obtained by the Indiana Geological Survey; interested users may wish to contact the Indiana Geological Survey for information on these more up-to-date sources.","[u'Denver Harper (Data and GIS compiler)', u'Indiana Geological Survey']",[u'Indiana Geological Survey'],Public,Purdue,"{""http://schema.org/downloadUrl"":""https://maps.indiana.edu/download/Geology/Coal_Colchester_Elevation.zip"",""urn:x-esri:serviceType:ArcGIS#DynamicMapLayer"":""https://maps.indiana.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Geology/Coal_Colchester_Elevation/MapServer/"",""http://schema.org/url"":""http://maps.indiana.edu/layerGallery.html"",""http://www.isotc211.org/schemas/2005/gmd/"":""http://64.90.181.107/geonetwork/srv/api/records/f13e9885-bf4b-46eb-81a4-06c213d78f1a/formatters/xml""}",,f13e9885-bf4b-46eb-81a4-06c213d78f1a,Polygon,2017-12-27T20:50:56Z,Shapefile,English,Dataset,"[u'Geoscientific Information', u'Geology']",IndianaMAP,11/24/00,1994,"[u'Indiana, United States', u'West Lafayette, Indiana, United States']","ENVELOPE(-88.0071, -87.1497, 39.6043, 38.1622)","38.88325,-87.5784",2000

Points represent monitoring stations attributed as occuring within the state of Indiana or along the Ohio River in Kentucky, or in Illinois along Lake Michigan. Joinable tables must be utilized to access data at specific stations for specific parameters. Five tables are available - tissue residue data (tischem.dbf), sediment chemistry data (sedichem.dbf), screening value, cancer slope factors, and noncancer reference doses for chemicals (reftabl.dbf), watershed summary data (watersh.dbf), biotoxicity data (biotox.dbf). US Environmental Protection Agency BASINS metadata reports - This dataset describes the accumulation of chemical contaminants in river, lake, ocean, and estuary bottoms and includes a screening assessment of the potential for associated adverse effects on human and environmental health. EPA evaluated more than 21,000 sampling stations nationwide using sediment chemistry data, chemical residue levels in edible tissue of aquatic organisms, and sediment toxicity data. Of the sampling stations evaluated, 5,521 stations were classified as Tier 1 (associated adverse effects are probable), 10,401 stations were classified as Tier 2 (associated adverse effects are possible, but expected infrequently), and 5,174 stations were classified as Tier 3 (no indication of associated adverse effects). Ninety-six watersheds were identified as areas of probable concern for sediment contamination. EPA believes that these watersheds represent the highest priority for further ecotoxicological assessments, risk analysis, temporal and spatial trend assessments, contaminant source evaluation, and management action because of the preponderance of evidence in these areas (although further evaluation is necessary). Also see the related report entitled The Incidence And Severity Of Sediment Contamination In Surface Waters of the United States, Volume 1, National Sediment Quality Survey (EPA 823-R-97-006, ) that was published in September 1997. For distribution with BASINS v.2.0, the spatial attributes of the database were prepared in Arcview shape file format while selected relational attributes were prepared in Arcview DBF file format. This data set provides individuals with observation level data that were used in the most geographically extensive investigation of sediment contamination ever performed in the United States. Based on this evaluation, sediment contamination exists at levels where associated adverse effects are probable in some locations within each State of the country.","[u'(creator): U. S.

The line segments have NOT been dissolved. The start and end point of each listing segment is approximate and located by described landmarks. The following excerpt from the NPS, NRI website describes the eligibility for a river to be listed- In order to be listed on the NRI, a river must be free-flowing and possess one or more Outstandingly Remarkable Values (ORVs). Thus, the eligibility analysis consists of an examination of the river's hydrology, including any man-made alterations, and an inventory of its natural, cultural, and recreational resources. There are a variety of methods to determine whether certain resources are so unique, rare or exemplary as to make them outstandingly remarkable. The determination that a river area contains ORVs is a professional judgment on the part of the interdisciplinary study team (IDT), based on objective, scientific analysis. Input from organizations and individuals familiar with specific river resources should be sought and documented as part of the process. In order to be assessed as outstandingly remarkable, a river-related value must be a unique, rare, or exemplary feature that is significant at a comparative regional or national scale. Dictionary definitions of the words unique and rare indicate that such a value would be one that is conspicuous example from among a number of similar values that are themselves uncommon or extraordinary.

d93efb5c-355d-4ac5-8417-803158f5c271,"Land Cover, Derived from the 2006 National Land Cover Database: Indiana, 2011","LAND_COVER_2006_USGS_IN is a grid (30-meter cell size) showing 2006 Land Cover data in Indiana. This grid is a subset of the National Land Cover Data (NLCD 2006) data set. There are 15 categories of land use shown in this data set when the associated layer file (LAND_COVER_2006_USGS_IN.LYR) is loaded. The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USGS for the NLCD 2006: The National Land Cover Database products are created through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium. The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Previously, NLCD consisted of three major data releases based on a 10-year cycle. These include a circa 1992 conterminous U.S. land cover dataset with one thematic layer (NLCD 1992), a circa 2001 50-state/Puerto Rico updated U.S. land cover database (NLCD 2001) with three layers including thematic land cover, percent imperviousness, and percent tree canopy, and a 1992/2001 Land Cover Change Retrofit Product. With these national data layers, there is often a 5-year time lag between the image capture date and product release. In some areas, the land cover can undergo significant change during production time, resulting in products that may be perpetually out of date. To address these issues, this circa 2006 NLCD land cover product (NLCD 2006) was conceived to meet user community needs for more frequent land cover monitoring (moving to a 5-year cycle) and to reduce the production time between image capture and product release. NLCD 2006 is designed to provide the user both updated land cover data and additional information that can be used to identify the pattern, nature, and magnitude of changes occurring between 2001 and 2006 for the conterminous United States at medium spatial resolution. For NLCD 2006, there are 3 primary data products: 1) NLCD 2006 Land Cover map; 2) NLCD 2001/2006 Change Pixels labeled with the 2006 land cover class; and 3) NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness. Four additional data products were developed to provide supporting documentation and to provide information for land cover change analysis tasks: 4) NLCD 2001/2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change; 5) NLCD 2001/2006 Maximum Potential Change derived from the raw spectral change analysis; 6) NLCD 2001/2006 From-To Change pixels; and 7) NLCD 2006 Path/Row Index vector file showing the footprint of Landsat scene pairs used to derive 2001/2006 spectral change with change pair acquisition dates and scene identification numbers included in the attribute table. In addition to the 2006 data products listed in the paragraph above, two of the original release NLCD 2001 data products have been revised and reissued. Generation of NLCD 2006 data products helped to identify some update issues in the NLCD 2001 land cover and percent developed imperviousness data products. These issues were evaluated and corrected, necessitating a reissue of NLCD 2001 data products (NLCD 2001 Version 2.0) as part of the NLCD 2006 release. A majority of NLCD 2001 updates occur in coastal mapping zones where NLCD 2001 was published prior to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) 2001 land cover products. NOAA C-CAP 2001 land cover has now been seamlessly integrated with NLCD 2001 land cover for all coastal zones. NLCD 2001 percent developed imperviousness was also updated as part of this process. Land cover maps, derivatives and all associated documents are considered provisional until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted. The NLCD 2006 is created on a path/row basis and mosaicked to create a seamless national product. Questions about the NLCD 2006 land cover product can be directed to the NLCD 2006 land cover mapping team at the USGS/EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.","[u'Indiana Geological Survey (Digital compiler)', u'United States Geological Survey (Author)']",[u'Indiana Geological Survey'],Public,Purdue,"{""http://schema.org/downloadUrl"":""http://maps.indiana.edu/download/Environment/Land_Cover_2006.zip"",""urn:x-esri:serviceType:ArcGIS#DynamicMapLayer"":""https://maps.indiana.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Environment/Land_Cover_2006/MapServer"",""http://schema.org/url"":""http://maps.indiana.edu/layerGallery.html"",""http://www.isotc211.org/schemas/2005/gmd/"":""http://64.90.181.107/geonetwork/srv/api/records/d93efb5c-355d-4ac5-8417-803158f5c271/formatters/xml""}",,d93efb5c-355d-4ac5-8417-803158f5c271,Raster,2017-12-27T20:51:00Z,Shapefile,English,Dataset,"[u'Imagery and Base Maps', u'Environment']",IndianaMAP,6/23/11,2007,"[u'Indiana, United States', u'Tippecano County, Indiana, United States', u'Wabash River, Indiana, United States']","ENVELOPE(-88.1607, -84.6882, 41.7753, 37.7554)","39.76535,-86.42445",2011

The 240 pit locations that were excluded did not have adequate quarter quarter section information that could be processed by Geographix software.

The data contained in this database represents a preliminary stage in a comprehensive compilation of abandoned sand and gravel pit data stored in the files of the Mineral Resources Section of the Indiana Geological Survey (IGS). The data were taken from a single Mineral Resources Section file titled DATA TABULATION CARDS: Sand and Gravel Pits which documents abandoned sand and gravel pits examined by IGS geologists in the late 1940s and early 1950s.

The following process is done by subbasin: high-resolution NHD geodatabase is checked out from USGS; six-acre catchment areas and streams are generated using best-available digital elevation model; areas, flowlines, and waterbodies are digitized to the 6-acre limit using the best available aerial photography, adding ftype to each feature; attributes from high-resolution NHD are conflated to the new linework; subbasin geodatabase is checked back in to USGS.. After the successful completion of the previous steps, the subbasin is downloaded from USGS; the NHDArea, NHDFlowline, and NHDWaterbody feature classes are reprojected to UTM NAD 83 Zone 16N; the reprojected NHDArea features are loaded into this dataset. DESCRIPTION FROM USGS: The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico.

The elevation maps were based on coal-test records and interpretations of geophysical logs that are included in the files of the Indiana Geological Survey. Data points were plotted by coal geologists of the Indiana Geological Survey and elevation contours were drawn by hand. The original work maps were compiled at a scale of 0.5 inch = 1 mile (scale, 1:126,720). Following completion of the investigations, the work maps showing elevation contours were subsequently scanned and digitized, and the resulting county coverages were then compiled into a single multicounty coverage. Elevations are given in feet, and the contour interval is 20 feet. Since the completion of this shapefile, additional data on coalbed elevations in selected areas has been obtained by the Indiana Geological Survey; interested users may wish to contact the Indiana Geological Survey for information on these more up-to-date sources.","[u'Indiana Geological Survey', u'Denver Harper']",[u'Indiana Geological Survey'],Public,Purdue,"{""http://schema.org/downloadUrl"":""https://maps.indiana.edu/download/Geology/Coal_Danville_Elevation.zip"",""urn:x-esri:serviceType:ArcGIS#DynamicMapLayer"":""https://maps.indiana.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Geology/Coal_Danville_Elevation/MapServer/"",""http://schema.org/url"":""http://maps.indiana.edu/layerGallery.html"",""http://www.isotc211.org/schemas/2005/gmd/"":""http://64.90.181.107/geonetwork/srv/api/records/c419af86-8cc2-4b09-a5e8-66ab4f5bbfb4/formatters/xml""}",,c419af86-8cc2-4b09-a5e8-66ab4f5bbfb4,Polygon,2017-12-27T20:50:43Z,Shapefile,English,Dataset,"[u'Geoscientific Information', u'Geology']",IndianaMAP,9/24/02,1994,"[u'Indiana, United States', u'Tippecano County, Indiana, United States', u'Wabash River, Indiana, United States']","ENVELOPE(-88.1289, -85.9371, 39.9275, 37.7705)","38.849,-87.033",2002

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile BROWNFIELDS: Indiana defines a brownfield site as a parcel of real estate that is abandoned or inactive; or may not be operated at its appropriate use; and on which expansion, redevelopment, or reuse is complicated; because of the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, a contaminant, petroleum, or a petroleum product that poses a risk to human health and the environment. As our undeveloped land continues to disappear, we recognize the need to redevelop and reuse land that may have viable buildings and infrastructure already present. The existence of buildings and infrastructure, and access to transportation resources can lower the costs to a potential developer. Redevelopment of brownfields properties benefits communities by rejuvenating vacant buildings, increasing the tax base and reducing blight. Because the potential environmental liability at these properties is unknown, prospective purchasers are unwilling to assume the risk of undetermined potential cleanup costs. Thus, the properties remain idle. In response to these issues the IDEM, in conjunction with the Indiana Development Finance Authority,and the Indiana Department of Commerce offers financial assistance in the form of grants and low-interest loans for site assessment, remediation, and demolition. The IDEM provides assistance by performing technical oversight and review.","[u'Indiana Department of Environmental Management, Office of Land Quality']","[u'Indiana Department of Environmental Management, Office of Land Quality']",Public,Purdue,"{""http://schema.org/downloadUrl"":""http://maps.indiana.edu/download/Environment/Remediation_Brownfields.zip"",""urn:x-esri:serviceType:ArcGIS#DynamicMapLayer"":""https://maps.indiana.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Environment/Remediation_Brownfields/MapServer"",""http://schema.org/url"":""http://maps.indiana.edu/layerGallery.html"",""http://www.isotc211.org/schemas/2005/gmd/"":""http://64.90.181.107/geonetwork/srv/api/records/fca584ae-dec6-460d-be81-a90738d2cf3c/formatters/xml""}",,fca584ae-dec6-460d-be81-a90738d2cf3c,Point,2017-12-27T20:50:48Z,Shapefile,English,Dataset,"[u'Environment', u'Pollution']",IndianaMAP,2/25/15,2015,"[u'Indiana, United States']","ENVELOPE(-87.567019, -84.828742, 41.752277, 38.076905)","39.914591,-86.1978805",2015

Industrial Waste Compliance GPS Points locate the entrance to facilities that generate and/or manage hazardous waste, non-hazardous industrial waste, and solid waste. The majority of the points collected are Large Quantity Generators (LQGs). Treatment Storage and Disposal facilities (TSDs) are also being collected. Occasionally, a Small Quantity Generator (SQG) or Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generator (CESQG) GPS points may be collected if the location has significant environmental issues. GPS data is collected, with portable GPS equipment, by Industrial Waste Compliance staff during scheduled compliance Inspections. GPS points may also be logged at nearby LQGs when the compliance inspector is conducting other compliance work in the area. TSD - Treatment Storage and Disposal Facility is a facility that may treat, store, and /or dispose hazardous waste. The facility is usually also a generator of hazardous waste. LQG - Large Quantity Generator is a facility that generates more than 1,000 Kilograms (2,200lbs.) of hazardous waste per month. SQG - Small Quantity Generator is a facility that generates less than 1,000 Kilograms (2,000 lbs.) but more than 100 Kilograms (220 lbs.) of hazardous waste per month. CESQG - Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generator is a facility that generates less than 100 Kilograms (220 lbs.) of hazardous waste per month. Industrial Waste site inspectors were trained in techniques and proper use of Global Positioning Systems. Trained staff then went into the field and collected GPS information at managed sites.

The 2009-2010 school districts represent districts in operation as of January 1, 2010. The elementary school districts provide education to the lower grade/age levels and the secondary school districts provide education to the upper grade/age levels. The unified school districts are districts that provide education to children of all school ages. In general, where there is a unified school district, no elementary or secondary school district exists (see exceptions described below), and where there is an elementary school district the secondary school district may or may not exist (see explanation below). The U.S. Census Bureau's Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) program provides annual estimates of income and poverty statistics for all school districts, counties, and states. The main objective of this program is to provide estimates of income and poverty for the administration of federal programs and the allocation of federal funds to local jurisdictions. In addition to these federal programs, state and local programs use the income and poverty estimates for distributing funds and managing programs. The SAIPE program produces the following county and state estimates: Total number of people in poverty. Number of childer under age 5 in poevery (for states only). number of related children ages 5 to 17 in families in poverty. Number of children under age 18 in poverty. Median household income.","[u'Indiana Geological Survey (processor)', u'Indiana Business Research Institute (data provider)', u'United States Department of Commerce, United States Census Bureau (creator)']",[u'United States Census Bureau'],Public,Purdue,"{""http://schema.org/downloadUrl"":""http://maps.indiana.edu/download/Demographics/Population_Children_Poverty_2011.zip"",""urn:x-esri:serviceType:ArcGIS#DynamicMapLayer"":""https://maps.indiana.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Demographics/Population_Children_Poverty_2011/MapServer"",""http://schema.org/url"":""http://maps.indiana.edu/layerGallery.html"",""http://www.isotc211.org/schemas/2005/gmd/"":""http://64.90.181.107/geonetwork/srv/api/records/d026bd05-d581-4477-9ed4-611082c8bf49/formatters/xml""}",,d026bd05-d581-4477-9ed4-611082c8bf49,Polygon,2017-12-27T20:50:50Z,Shapefile,English,Dataset,"[u'Boundaries', u'Society', u'Census', u'Demographics']",IndianaMAP,8/27/12,2012,"[u'Indiana, United States', u'Tippecano County, Indiana, United States', u'Wabash River, Indiana, United States']","ENVELOPE(-88.161392, -84.688378, 41.781127, 37.755397)","39.768262,-86.424885",2012

These ongoing or recently completed projects, conducted in collaboration with the U.S. EPA regional offices and with state resource management agencies, involve refining ecoregions, defining subregions, and locating sets of reference sites. Designed to serve as a spatial framework for environmental resource management, ecoregions denote areas within which ecosystems (and the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources) are generally similar. The most immediate needs are to develope regional biological criteria and water quality standards and to set management goals for nonpoint source pollution. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of the patterns and the composition of biotic and abiotic phenomena that affect or reflect differences in ecosystem quality and integrity (Wiken 1986; Omernik 1987, 1995). These phenomena include geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another regardless of the hierarchical level. Because of possible confusion with other meanings of terms for different levels of ecologic regions, a Roman numeral classification scheme has been adopted for this effort. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into nine ecological regions whereas at Level II the continent is subdivided into 32 classes. Level III is the hierarchical level shown on this map. For portions of the United States the ecoregions have been further subdivided to level IV. The applications of the ecoregions are explained in Gallant et al. (1989) and in reports and publications from the state and regional projects. For additional information, contact James M.

The data were provided by personnel of Indiana Department of Homeland Security (IDHS) on June 29, 2009. This data set was provided by IDHS in ESRI shapefile format and was named 2008_09_20_IN_Firestations.shp. The following is a description of the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP) provided by personnel of the Indiana Geographic Information Council (IGIC): Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP) After September 11, 2001, federal decision makers needed a single place to go for geospatial data. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) stood up a tiger team to determine the type of information needed for the nations critical infrastructure and developed an acquisition strategy to provide that data to the federal community. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) Working Group provided guidance in the development of the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP). There are currently two different version of HSIP data: HSIP Gold and HSIP Freedom. HSIP Gold: Designed to combine all geospatial data, and Geospatial Intelligence products into a single, integrated database. HSIP Gold is a collection of base map layers and homeland security related geospatial data. There are many sources, including licensed commodity datasets and Federal & State agency data. The HSIP Gold data was created for Federal government homeland security and homeland defense purposes. These data are only available to state and local governments for viewing purposes across a thin client network. This is referred to as disclosure in the Federal licensing agreements with the private sector contributors. However, Federal licenses also require that in the event of declared emergencies, that the data may be released to state and local governments to support their operations. Non-government organizations can not access the HSIP Gold data. HSIP Freedom: NGAs goal is to provide complete datasets with no limits on distribution to state and local responders. The challenge is the private-sector license restrictions. NGA came up with different approach  HSIP Freedom where state and local government provide data to DHS or NGA, which could be improved and returned to state and locals so they can get benefit from that data. Then the states would be able to look at same data as federal government and distribute it as they see fit. The current emphasis of the HSIP Freedom program is on sharing and improving data to create uniform State & Federal information on: Fire Stations, EMS Stations & Ambulance Services, Police Stations, Prisons & Jails, Hospitals & Urgent Care Clinics. TechniGraphicS, Inc. (TGS) was the contractor to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) for development of this HSIP Freedom data. Most improvements to date have been done by TGS telephoning local officials to verify the name, address, phone number, and geospatial location of their facilities. Geospatial location is determined by asking the local official to describe their location relative to landmarks visible in orthoimagery. TGS incorporates the improved State data into the License Free HSIP Freedom product and makes it available to the states. They also incorporate the improved State data into HSIP Gold and deliver it to NGA. States are encouraged to share these improved data with the U.S. Geological Survey for use in The National Map and for the new generation of graphic products being produced at USGS for emergency responders. The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDHS for the source shapefile named 2008_09_20_IN_Firestations.shp: Fire Stations in Indiana Any location where fire fighters are stationed or based out of, or where equipment that such personnel use in carrying out their jobs is stored for ready use. Fire Departments not having a permanent location are included, in which case their location has been depicted at the city/town hall or at the center of their service area if a city/town hall does not exist. This dataset includes those locations primarily engaged in forest or grasslands fire fighting, including fire lookout towers if the towers are in current use for fire protection purposes. This dataset includes both private and governmental entities. Fire fighting training academies are also included. This dataset is comprised completely of license free data.

TrueWind has also produced data files of the predicted wind speed frequency distribution and speed and energy by direction. The maps and data files are provided on a CD with the ArcReader software, which will enable users to view, print, copy, and query the maps and wind rose data. The MesoMap system consists of an integrated set of atmospheric simulation models, databases, and computers and storage systems. At the core of MesoMap is MASS (Mesoscale Atmospheric Simulation System), a numerical weather model, which simulates the physics of the atmosphere. MASS is coupled to a simpler wind flow model, WindMap, which is used to refine the spatial resolution of MASS and account for localized effects of terrain and surface roughness. MASS simulates weather conditions over a region for 366 historical days randomly selected from a 15-year period. When the runs are finished, the results are input into WindMap. In this project, the MASS model was run on a grid spacing of 1.7 km and WindMap on a grid spacing of 200 m. The wind maps show that the best wind resource in Indiana is found in the northcentral part of the state. The mean wind speed at 50 m height between Indianapolis, Kokomo, and Lafayette, and to the northwest of Lafayette, is predicted to be in the range of 6.5 to 7 m/s, and the mean wind power is predicted to be about 250 to 350 W/m2, or NREL class 2 to 3. In the rest of northern Indiana, the wind speed tends to be around 0.5 m/s lower, and the wind power is a solid class 2. In southern Indiana, a wind speed of 4.5 to 6 m/s and a wind power class of 1 to 2 prevails. The main reason for this wind resource distribution pattern is that the land is much more forested in the southern half of the state than in the northern half. Topography also plays a role, as does the track of the jet stream.","[u'TrueWind Solutions, LLC (data creator)', u'Indiana Department of Commerce (data provider)', u'Denver Harper (metadata creator)', u'Michael Brower (data creator)', u'Indiana Geological Survey (metadata creator)', u'Chris Dintaman (metadata creator)', u'National Renewable Energy Laboratory (data creator)']",[u'Indiana Geological Survey'],Public,Purdue,"{""http://schema.org/downloadUrl"":""http://maps.indiana.edu/download/Environment/Wind_Speed_100m.zip"",""urn:x-esri:serviceType:ArcGIS#DynamicMapLayer"":""https://maps.indiana.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Environment/Wind_Speed_100m/MapServer"",""http://schema.org/url"":""http://maps.indiana.edu/layerGallery.html"",""http://www.isotc211.org/schemas/2005/gmd/"":""http://64.90.181.107/geonetwork/srv/api/records/215bdfd8-ed31-4fcc-9804-f63d5e4ece70/formatters/xml""}",,215bdfd8-ed31-4fcc-9804-f63d5e4ece70,Raster,2017-12-27T20:50:45Z,Shapefile,English,Dataset,"[u'Climatology, Meteorology and Atmosphere', u'Wind power']",IndianaMAP,9/5/07,2007,"[u'Indiana, United States']","ENVELOPE(-88.68757, -84.223033, 42.086677, 37.434122)","39.7603995,-86.4553015",2007

25ee2f44-24ed-469f-a325-54ea2d41f289,"Groundwater recharge rates to shallow aquifers: Indiana, 2015","Aquifer_Recharge_Near_Surface_IN is a raster data layer that displays the results of a regression analysis to determine the estimated rate of diffuse groundwater recharge to the water table in shallow aquifers in Indiana based on numerous landscape-level variables as predictors. The goal of this project was to use an objective, reproducible methodology to estimate groundwater recharge rates in both glaciated and driftless environments. This groundwater-recharge raster layer was developed by combining a multiple regression analysis of groundwater recharge with characteristics of near-surface geologic materials. The groundwater recharge data used in the multiple regression analysis was derived from calculations of groundwater baseflow and surface-water runoff for 279 streams in Indiana. Estimates of groundwater base flow were determined using hydrograph separation analysis (Institute of Hydrology, 1980) determined using a local-minimums approach with a recession slope test, and were converted to recharge by multiplying by using estimates of runoff following Wolock (2003). The baseflow index (BFI) provides the proportion of runoff that is assumed to be groundwater contribution, so recharge was estimated as BFI * interpolated statewide runoff (not runoff per basin). The average annual rate of groundwater recharge (in/year) was used as the dependent variable in a multiple regression analysis using ordinary least squares with several landscape and morphometric independent variables representing geologic, terrain, climate, and hydrogeologic characteristics. The regression model developed for Indiana had a global R2 value of 0.50, and the most influential variables at the 95% confidence level were: - Cumulative percent area of upstream impervious surfaces - Surface clay thickness - Percent of clay in soil - Average annual air temperature - Presence/absence of unconsolidated aquifers - Slope of ground surface - Cumulative percent area of upstream water bodies - Sand composition of water well boreholes - Cumulative percent area of upstream medium-height vegetation - Hydrologic group classification of soil (A,B,C,D - SSURGO) The regression model was used as a mapping tool to spatially distribute estimates of recharge across Indiana, incorporating details of the important landscape variables.","[u'Indiana Geological Survey (IGS)', u'Center for Geospatial Data Analysis (CGDA)', u'Sally L.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) is the principal Federal agency that provides information to the public on the extent and status of the Nation's wetlands and provides stewardship for the wetlands data that comprise the Wetlands Layer of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure. In the formulation of this data layer, historic wetlands are defined as areas where there is evidence that a wetland once existed. This evidence can be from historical map information inventories of past wetland extent or other information collected that relate directly to data on wetland filling, drainage or other modifications. Historic wetlands have been identified using several different techniques depending on the availability and type of information used to locate these areas and user needs. For example, historical maps often provide information about past wetland extent or location and can be useful tools to identify historic wetlands. Historic wetlands have been identified as polygonal data. No linear features have been included. Historic wetland polygons are not classified as wetlands and have no wetland labels or attribution. Since these features no longer exist, boundary delineations are considered approximations based on topography, previously mapped information or indications of historic water levels.","[u'U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service']",[u'U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service'],Public,Purdue,"{""http://schema.org/downloadUrl"":""http://maps.indiana.edu/download/Hydrology/Wetlands_Historic_NWI.zip"",""urn:x-esri:serviceType:ArcGIS#DynamicMapLayer"":""https://maps.indiana.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Hydrology/Wetlands_Historic_NWI/MapServer"",""http://schema.org/url"":""http://maps.indiana.edu/layerGallery.html"",""http://www.isotc211.org/schemas/2005/gmd/"":""http://64.90.181.107/geonetwork/srv/api/records/00b647c9-8bc0-47a2-aa1d-fdc302da0b2f/formatters/xml""}",,00b647c9-8bc0-47a2-aa1d-fdc302da0b2f,Polygon,2017-12-27T20:51:14Z,Shapefile,English,Dataset,"[u'Environment', u'Biota', u'Geoscientific Information', u'Inland Waters', u'Hydrology']",IndianaMAP,10/20/14,2005,"[u'Indiana, United States']","ENVELOPE(-88.0114746094, -84.8254394531, 41.7549221677, 37.7880813841)","39.7715017759,-86.41845703125",2014

The U.S. Census Bureau first reported data for VTDs following the 1980 census. Because the U.S. Census Bureau requires that VTDs follow boundaries of census blocks, participating states often adjusted the boundaries of the VTDs they submit for data tabulation purposes to conform to census block boundaries. If requested by the participating state, the U.S. Census Bureau identifies these adjusted VTDs as pseudo-VTDs. For Census 2000, each VTD is identified by a one- to six-character alphanumeric census code that is unique within county.

The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) stood up a tiger team to determine the type of information needed for the nations critical infrastructure and developed an acquisition strategy to provide that data to the federal community. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) Working Group provided guidance in the development of the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP). There are currently two different version of HSIP data: HSIP Gold and HSIP Freedom. HSIP Gold: Designed to combine all geospatial data, and Geospatial Intelligence products into a single, integrated database. HSIP Gold is a collection of base map layers and homeland security related geospatial data. There are many sources, including licensed commodity datasets and Federal & State agency data. The HSIP Gold data was created for Federal government homeland security and homeland defense purposes. These data are only available to state and local governments for viewing purposes across a thin client network. This is referred to as disclosure in the Federal licensing agreements with the private sector contributors. However, Federal licenses also require that in the event of declared emergencies, that the data may be released to state and local governments to support their operations. Non-government organizations can not access the HSIP Gold data. HSIP Freedom: NGAs goal is to provide complete datasets with no limits on distribution to state and local responders. The challenge is the private-sector license restrictions. NGA came up with different approach  HSIP Freedom where state and local government provide data to DHS or NGA, which could be improved and returned to state and locals so they can get benefit from that data. Then the states would be able to look at same data as federal government and distribute it as they see fit. The current emphasis of the HSIP Freedom program is on sharing and improving data to create uniform State & Federal information on: Fire Stations, EMS Stations & Ambulance Services, Police Stations, Prisons & Jails, Hospitals & Urgent Care Clinics. TechniGraphicS, Inc. (TGS) was the contractor to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) for development of this HSIP Freedom data. Most improvements to date have been done by TGS telephoning local officials to verify the name, address, phone number, and geospatial location of their facilities. Geospatial location is determined by asking the local official to describe their location relative to landmarks visible in orthoimagery. TGS incorporates the improved State data into the License Free HSIP Freedom product and makes it available to the states. They also incorporate the improved State data into HSIP Gold and deliver it to NGA. States are encouraged to share these improved data with the U.S. Geological Survey for use in The National Map and for the new generation of graphic products being produced at USGS for emergency responders. The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDHS for the source shapefile named 2008_09_20_IN_Hospitals.shp: Hospitals in Indiana The term hospital means an institution which: (1) is primarily engaged in providing, by or under the supervision of physicians, to inpatients  (A) diagnostic services and therapeutic services for medical diagnosis, treatment, and care of injured, disabled, or sick persons, or  (B) rehabilitation services for the rehabilitation of injured, disabled, or sick persons; (5) provides 24-hour nursing service rendered or supervised by a registered professional nurse, and has a licensed practical nurse or registered professional nurse on duty at all times; ... (7) in the case of an institution in any State in which State or applicable local law provides for the licensing of hospitals,  (A) is licensed pursuant to such law or  (B) is approved, by the agency of such State or locality responsible for licensing hospitals, as meeting the standards established for such licensing; (Excerpt from Title XVIII of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C.  1395x(e)], ) Included in this dataset are General Medical and Surgical Hospitals, Psychiatric and Substance Abuse Hospitals, and Specialty Hospitals (e.g., Children's Hospitals, Cancer Hospitals, Maternity Hospitals, Rehabilitation Hospitals, etc.). TGS has made a concerted effort to include all general medical/surgical hospitals in Indiana. Other types of hospitals are included if they were represented in datasets sent by the state. Therefore, not all of the specialty hospitals in Indiana are represented in this dataset. Hospitals operated by the Veterans Administration (VA) are included, even if the state they are located in does not license VA Hospitals. Nursing homes and Urgent Care facilities are excluded because they are included in a separate dataset. Locations that are administrative offices only are excluded from the dataset. Records with -DOD appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries. Text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. All diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics. The currentness of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] field. Based upon this field, the oldest record dates from 10/26/2006 and the newest record dates from 07/10/2008.","[u'TechniGraphics, Inc.', u'Indiana Department of Homeland Security']",[u'Indiana Department of Homeland Security'],Public,Purdue,"{""http://schema.org/downloadUrl"":""http://maps.indiana.edu/download/Infrastructure/Critical_Facilities_IDHS_Hospitals.zip"",""urn:x-esri:serviceType:ArcGIS#DynamicMapLayer"":""https://maps.indiana.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Infrastructure/Critical_Facilities_IDHS_Hospitals/MapServer"",""http://schema.org/url"":""http://maps.indiana.edu/layerGallery.html"",""http://www.isotc211.org/schemas/2005/gmd/"":""http://64.90.181.107/geonetwork/srv/api/records/e1aa0f34-8256-4c21-8055-51912b641a03/formatters/xml""}",,e1aa0f34-8256-4c21-8055-51912b641a03,Point,2017-12-27T20:51:17Z,Shapefile,English,Dataset,"[u'Location', u'Structure', u'Hospitals']",IndianaMAP,6/29/09,2009,"[u'Indiana, United States', u'Tippecano County, Indiana, United States', u'Wabash River, Indiana, United States']","ENVELOPE(-87.590065, -84.882367, 41.706514, 37.927955)","39.8172345,-86.236216",2009

The source data was last updated in October 1997. Stream segments were obtained from 1:100K National Hydrography Dataset. The following was excerpted from the website for the Natural Resources Commission: In 1993, the Natural Resources Commission adopted its Outstanding Rivers List for Indiana. The listing was published in the Indiana Register on March 1 of that year as Information Bulletin #4 in Volume 16, Number 6, page 1677 through 1680 (sometimes cited as 16 IR 1677). The listing has also been specifically incorporated by reference into statutes and rules. Notably, the listing is referenced in the standards for utility line crossings within floodways, formerly governed by IC 14-28-2 and now controlled by 310 IAC 6-1-16 through 310 IAC 6-1-18. See, also, the general permit for logjam removals, implemented as an emergency rule and pending for adoption as a permanent rule at 310 IAC 6-1-20. Except where incorporated into a statute or rule, the listing is intended to provide guidance rather than to have regulatory application. A special listing was prepared by the division of outdoor recreation of the department of natural resources. The listing is a corrected and condensed version of a listing complied by American Rivers and dated October 1990. There are about 2,000 river miles included on the listing, a figure which represents less than 9% of the estimated 24,000 total river miles in Indiana.

This data set has been updated using the U.S. Census Bureau's Census 2005 TIGER/Line Files (First Edition), which contain updated ZCTA's reflecting U.S. Postal Service ZIP Code changes through October, 2002. There will be no further updates of ZCTA's until required for the 2010 Census. The following is excerpted from an Adobe Acrobat PDF document produced by the U.S. Census Bureau pertaining to ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs): ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are a new statistical entity developed by the U.S. Census Bureau for tabulating summary statistics. ZCTAs are generalized area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas. They represent either USPS five- or three-digit ZIP Code areas. ZCTAs are created based on the following criteria:  ZCTAs follow census block boundaries. The ZCTA code for each census block generally represents the majority ZIP Code of the addresses within that census block.  ZCTAs are not exact representations of the USPSs ZIP Code delivery areas.  ZCTA codes cover all land and water areas.  ZCTAs include some dedicated post office box ZIP Codes in areas served only by post office boxes.  ZCTAs representing post office box ZIP Codes generally have more than 10 addresses.  ZCTAs exclude unique, single delivery point ZIP Codes, such as those for firms and organizations.  ZCTAs are distinct from other Census Bureau statistical areas, such as census tracts, because they are not stable over time and are computer-delineated based on the location of addresses at the time of Census 2000 rather than manually delineated by local program participants or Census Bureau staff before the census.  ZCTAs are distinct from other representations of ZIP Codes because they are based on address information and ZIP Codes collected or verified during Census 2000 operations.  ZCTAs frequently cross county and place boundaries and may occasionally cross from one state into another. For a more detailed discussion of how the U.S. Census Bureau created ZCTAs, please open one of the Adobe Acrobat files found at http://www.census.gov/geo/ZCTA/zcta.html The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by INDOT for the source shapefile DOTGIS.ZCTA5_TIGER05_IN.SHP: The 2005 First Edition TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the Census TIGER database. The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on the latest available governmental unit boundaries. The Census TIGER database represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts. However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation. The 2005 First Edition TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physical features and governmental and statistical boundaries. The files contain information distributed over a series of record types for the spatial objects of a county. There are 19 record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points, and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps. Other geographic information contained in the files includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census feature class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types, address ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features, landmark point features, area landmarks, and area boundaries.","[u'United States Department of Commerce, United States Census Bureau (creator)', u'Indiana Department of Transportation, Business Information and Technology Systems, GIS Mapping (processor)']","[u'Indiana Department of Transportation, Business Information and Technology Systems, GIS Mapping']",Public,Purdue,"{""http://schema.org/downloadUrl"":""http://maps.indiana.edu/download/Reference/Zip_Codes_USCB.zip"",""urn:x-esri:serviceType:ArcGIS#DynamicMapLayer"":""https://maps.indiana.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Reference/Zip_Codes_USCB/MapServer"",""http://schema.org/url"":""http://maps.indiana.edu/layerGallery.html"",""http://www.isotc211.org/schemas/2005/gmd/"":""http://64.90.181.107/geonetwork/srv/api/records/cd68ed44-49c8-4445-bd61-7dfaa0385b1b/formatters/xml""}",,cd68ed44-49c8-4445-bd61-7dfaa0385b1b,Point,2017-12-27T20:50:50Z,Shapefile,English,Dataset,"[u'Boundaries', u'Society', u'Postal codes']",IndianaMAP,9/13/06,2006,"[u'Indiana, United States', u'Tippecano County, Indiana, United States', u'Wabash River, Indiana, United States']","ENVELOPE(-88.161392, -84.688378, 41.781127, 37.755397)","39.768262,-86.424885",2006

These reports included maps showing thickness of the Springfield Coal Member (Petersburg Formation, Pennsylvanian). The thickness maps were based on coal-test records, mine-map notations, and interpretations of geophysical logs that are included in the files of the Indiana Geological Survey. Data points were plotted by coal geologists of the Indiana Geological Survey and thickness contours were drawn by hand. The original work maps were compiled at a scale of 0.5 inch = 1 mile (1:126,720). Following completion of the investigations, the work maps showing thickness contours were subsequently scanned and digitized, and the resulting county coverages were then compiled into a single multi-county coverage. Different thickness ranges were utilized in the various counties; these thickness ranges (given in feet) are retained in the final map.

This is the publication guideline for cadastral data that is intended to provide a common format and structure and content for cadastral information that can be made available across jurisdictional boundaries, providing a consistent and uniform cadastral data to meet business need that includes connections to the source information from the data stewards. The data stewards determine which data are published and should be contacted for any questions on data content or for additional information. The cadastral publication data is data provided by cadastral data producers in a standard form on a regular basis. Cadastral publication data has two primary components, land parcel data and cadastral reference data. It is important to recognize that the publication data are not the same as the operation and maintenance or production data. The production data is structured to optimize maintenance processes, is integrated with internal agency operations and contains much more detail than the publication data. The publication data is a subset of the more complete production data and is reformatted to meet a national standard so data can be integrated across jurisdictional boundaries and be presented in a consistent and standard form nationally.","[u'U.S. Department of the Interior - Bureau of Land Management (BLM)', u'Indiana Geological Survey']",[u'U.S. Department of the Interior - Bureau of Land Management (BLM) (Eastern States Office)'],Public,Purdue,"{""http://schema.org/downloadUrl"":""http://maps.indiana.edu/download/Reference/PLSS_CadNSDI_BLM.zip"",""urn:x-esri:serviceType:ArcGIS#DynamicMapLayer"":""https://maps.indiana.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Reference/PLSS_CadNSDI_BLM/MapServer"",""http://schema.org/url"":""http://maps.indiana.edu/layerGallery.html"",""http://www.isotc211.org/schemas/2005/gmd/"":""http://64.90.181.107/geonetwork/srv/api/records/dc645bfc-73d6-4dad-a48c-607c06f63b2f/formatters/xml""}",,dc645bfc-73d6-4dad-a48c-607c06f63b2f,Polygon,2017-12-27T20:51:16Z,Shapefile,English,Dataset,"[u'Location', u'Intelligence and Military', u'Boundaries', u'Public land survey system']",IndianaMAP,6/9/14,2014,"[u'Indiana, United States', u'Tippecano County, Indiana, United States', u'Wabash River, Indiana, United States']","ENVELOPE(-88.1607, -84.6882, 41.7753, 37.7554)","39.76535,-86.42445",2014

The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USGS for the local-resolution NHD feature class named NHD_LOCALRES_WATERBODY_IN: This dataset was improved to local resolution (1:2,400) as part of the Indiana Local Resolution NHD Project. The following process is done by subbasin: high-resolution NHD geodatabase is checked out from USGS; six-acre catchment areas and streams are generated using best-available digital elevation model; areas, flowlines, and waterbodies are digitized to the 6-acre limit using the best available aerial photography, adding ftype to each feature; attributes from high-resolution NHD are conflated to the new linework; subbasin geodatabase is checked back in to USGS.. After the successful completion of the previous steps, the subbasin is downloaded from USGS; the NHDArea, NHDFlowline, and NHDWaterbody feature classes are reprojected to UTM NAD 83 Zone 16N; the reprojected NHDArea features are loaded into this dataset. DESCRIPTION FROM USGS: The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.","[u'U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (Data author)', u'Indiana Department of Natural Resources (Data provider)', u'Chris Dintaman (Data processor)', u'Indiana Geographic Information Office (Data provider)', u'Indiana Geological Survey (Data processor)']",[u'United States Geological Survey'],Public,Purdue,"{""http://schema.org/downloadUrl"":""http://maps.indiana.edu/download/Hydrology/Water_Bodies_Lakes_LocalRes.zip"",""urn:x-esri:serviceType:ArcGIS#DynamicMapLayer"":""https://maps.indiana.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Hydrology/Water_Bodies_Lakes_LocalRes/MapServer"",""http://schema.org/url"":""http://maps.indiana.edu/layerGallery.html"",""http://www.isotc211.org/schemas/2005/gmd/"":""http://64.90.181.107/geonetwork/srv/api/records/6e6e45e2-0050-438e-830b-205781ccb7c9/formatters/xml""}",,6e6e45e2-0050-438e-830b-205781ccb7c9,Polygon,2017-12-27T20:50:44Z,Shapefile,English,Dataset,"[u'Inland Waters', u'Environment', u'Lakes', u'Hydrology']",IndianaMAP,8/6/15,2015,"[u'Indiana, United States']","ENVELOPE(-88.845514, -83.559014, 46.102346, 37.134628)","41.618487,-86.202264",2015

04c8a745-46ff-4a74-b955-4ff928db4678,"Mean Wind Power at Height of 100 Meters above Ground, Derived from Mesoscale Atmospheric Simulation System and WindMap: Indiana, 2007","The following is excerpted from an unpublished report by Michael Brower (2004): Using the MesoMap system, TrueWind has produced maps of mean wind speed in Indiana for heights of 30, 50, 70, and 100 m above ground, as well as a map of wind power at 50 m. TrueWind has also produced data files of the predicted wind speed frequency distribution and speed and energy by direction. The maps and data files are provided on a CD with the ArcReader software, which will enable users to view, print, copy, and query the maps and wind rose data. The MesoMap system consists of an integrated set of atmospheric simulation models, databases, and computers and storage systems. At the core of MesoMap is MASS (Mesoscale Atmospheric Simulation System), a numerical weather model, which simulates the physics of the atmosphere. MASS is coupled to a simpler wind flow model, WindMap, which is used to refine the spatial resolution of MASS and account for localized effects of terrain and surface roughness. MASS simulates weather conditions over a region for 366 historical days randomly selected from a 15-year period. When the runs are finished, the results are input into WindMap. In this project, the MASS model was run on a grid spacing of 1.7 km and WindMap on a grid spacing of 200 m. The wind maps show that the best wind resource in Indiana is found in the northcentral part of the state. The mean wind speed at 50 m height between Indianapolis, Kokomo, and Lafayette, and to the northwest of Lafayette, is predicted to be in the range of 6.5 to 7 m/s, and the mean wind power is predicted to be about 250 to 350 W/m2, or NREL class 2 to 3. In the rest of northern Indiana, the wind speed tends to be around 0.5 m/s lower, and the wind power is a solid class 2. In southern Indiana, a wind speed of 4.5 to 6 m/s and a wind power class of 1 to 2 prevails.

The thickness maps were based on interpretations of coal-test records, mine-map notations, and geophysical logs that are included in the files of the Indiana Geological Survey. Data points were plotted by coal geologists of the Indiana Geological Survey and thickness contours were drawn by hand. The original work maps were compiled at a scale of 0.5 inch = 1 mile (scale, 1:126,720). Following completion of the investigations, the work maps showing thickness contours were subsequently scanned and digitized, and the resulting county coverages were then compiled into a single multicounty coverage. Different thickness ranges were utilized in the various counties; these thickness ranges (given in feet) are retained in the final map.

Discussion of these data, which are estimates produced under the Census Bureau's Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) program, are provided at . The following is excerpted from metata of the U.S. Census Bureau (2013-2014 School Districts) and also from the Web page of the SAIPE program ( http://www.census.gov/did/www/saipe/downloads/sd13/README.txt ) : School Districts are single-purpose administrative units within which local officials provide public educational services for the area's residents. The Census Bureau obtains school district boundaries, names, local education agency codes, grade ranges, and school district levels biennially from state school officials. The Census Bureau collects this information for the primary purpose of providing the U.S. Department of Education with annual estimates of the number of children in poverty within each school district, county, and state. This information serves as the basis for the Department of Education to determine the annual allocation of Title I funding to states and school districts. The 2014 TIGER/Line Shapefiles include separate shapefiles for elementary, secondary, and unified school districts. The 2014 shapefiles contain information from the 2013-2014 school year. The 2013-2014 school districts represent districts in operation as of January 1, 2014. The elementary school districts provide education to the lower grade/age levels and the secondary school districts provide education to the upper grade/age levels. The unified school districts are districts that provide education to children of all school ages. In general, where there is a unified school district, no elementary or secondary school district exists (see exceptions described below), and where there is an elementary school district the secondary school district may or may not exist (see explanation below). The U.S. Census Bureau's Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) program provides annual estimates of income and poverty statistics for all school districts, counties, and states. The main objective of this program is to provide estimates of income and poverty for the administration of federal programs and the allocation of federal funds to local jurisdictions. In addition to these federal programs, state and local programs use the income and poverty estimates for distributing funds and managing programs. The SAIPE program produces the following county and state estimates: Total number of people in poverty. Number of childer under age 5 in poevery (for states only). Number of related children ages 5 to 17 in families in poverty. Number of children under age 18 in poverty.

For a detailed definition and discussion on MRLC and the NLCD 2001 products, refer to Homer et al. (2003) and . The NLCD 2001 was created by partitioning the U.S. into mapping zones. A total of 66 mapping zones were delineated within the conterminous U.S. based on ecoregion and geographical characteristics, edgematching features and the size requirement of Landsat mosaics. Mapping zone 60 encompasses whole or portions of several states in the mid-Atlantic region, including the states of New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and the District of Columbia.

After the apportionment of congressional seats among the states, based on census population counts, each state is responsible for establishing CDs for the purpose of electing representatives. Each CD is to be as equal in population to all other CDs in the state as practicable. The CDs in effect at the time of Census 2000 were those of the 106th Congress, whose session began in January 1999. The boundaries were identical to those reflected in the 107th CD boundary files. The CDs for the 103rd Congress (January 1993 to 1995) were the first to reflect redistricting based on the 1990 census. The 103rd CDs remained in effect through Census 2000, except where a state initiative or a court-ordered redistricting required a change. Six states redistricted for the 104th Congress (Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, South Carolina, and Virginia), five states redistricted for the 105th Congress (Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Texas), and three states (New York, North Carolina, and Virginia) redistricted for the 106th Congress. In North Carolina the 1998 Congressional Plan A was used for the 1998 congressional elections. It was created in response to a court ruling which held the 1997 plan, 97 House/Senate Plan A, unconstitutional. These boundaries are reflected in the 106th CD boundary files. The Supreme Court has since reversed that lower court ruling and the 1997 plan, 97 House/Senate Plan A, (reflected in the 107th CD boundary files) was used for the 2000 North Carolina congressional elections. The 108th Congress is the first to reflect reapportionment and redistricting based on Census 2000 data.","[u'Chris Dintaman (Data processor)', u'United States Department of Commerce, United States Census Bureau (Data creator)', u'Indiana Geological Survey (Data processor)']",[u'Indiana Geological Survey (IGS)'],Public,Purdue,"{""http://schema.org/downloadUrl"":""http://maps.indiana.edu/download/Government/Congress_111th_Districts.zip"",""http://schema.org/url"":""http://maps.indiana.edu/layerGallery.html"",""http://www.isotc211.org/schemas/2005/gmd/"":""http://64.90.181.107/geonetwork/srv/api/records/7464b722-d1e8-4ac3-a35c-f85c49215899/formatters/xml""}",,7464b722-d1e8-4ac3-a35c-f85c49215899,Polygon,2017-12-27T20:50:55Z,Shapefile,English,Dataset,"[u'Boundaries', u'Election districts']",IndianaMAP,2/25/09,2009,"[u'Indiana, United States']","ENVELOPE(-88.0972, -84.6884, 41.7734, 37.7606)","39.767,-86.3928",2009

The data were provided by personnel of Indiana Department of Homeland Security (IDHS) on June 29, 2009. This data set was provided by IDHS in ESRI shapefile format and was named 2008_09_20_IN_EMS.shp. The following is a description of the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP) provided by personnel of the Indiana Geographic Information Council (IGIC): Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP) After September 11, 2001, federal decision makers needed a single place to go for geospatial data. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) stood up a tiger team to determine the type of information needed for the nations critical infrastructure and developed an acquisition strategy to provide that data to the federal community. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) Working Group provided guidance in the development of the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP). There are currently two different version of HSIP data: HSIP Gold and HSIP Freedom. HSIP Gold: Designed to combine all geospatial data, and Geospatial Intelligence products into a single, integrated database. HSIP Gold is a collection of base map layers and homeland security related geospatial data. There are many sources, including licensed commodity datasets and Federal & State agency data. The HSIP Gold data was created for Federal government homeland security and homeland defense purposes. These data are only available to state and local governments for viewing purposes across a thin client network. This is referred to as disclosure in the Federal licensing agreements with the private sector contributors. However, Federal licenses also require that in the event of declared emergencies, that the data may be released to state and local governments to support their operations. Non-government organizations can not access the HSIP Gold data. HSIP Freedom: NGAs goal is to provide complete datasets with no limits on distribution to state and local responders. The challenge is the private-sector license restrictions. NGA came up with different approach  HSIP Freedom where state and local government provide data to DHS or NGA, which could be improved and returned to state and locals so they can get benefit from that data. Then the states would be able to look at same data as federal government and distribute it as they see fit. The current emphasis of the HSIP Freedom program is on sharing and improving data to create uniform State & Federal information on: Fire Stations, EMS Stations & Ambulance Services, Police Stations, Prisons & Jails, Hospitals & Urgent Care Clinics. TechniGraphicS, Inc. (TGS) was the contractor to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) for development of this HSIP Freedom data. Most improvements to date have been done by TGS telephoning local officials to verify the name, address, phone number, and geospatial location of their facilities. Geospatial location is determined by asking the local official to describe their location relative to landmarks visible in orthoimagery. TGS incorporates the improved State data into the License Free HSIP Freedom product and makes it available to the states. They also incorporate the improved State data into HSIP Gold and deliver it to NGA. States are encouraged to share these improved data with the U.S. Geological Survey for use in The National Map and for the new generation of graphic products being produced at USGS for emergency responders. The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDHS for the source shapefile named 2008_09_20_IN_EMS.shp: EMS Locations in Indiana The EMS stations dataset consists of any location where emergency medical services (EMS) personnel are stationed or based out of, or where equipment that such personnel use in carrying out their jobs is stored for ready use. Ambulance services are included even if they only provide transportation services, but not if they are located at, and operated by, a hospital. If an independent ambulance service or EMS provider happens to be collocated with a hospital, it will be included in this dataset. The dataset includes both private and governmental entities. This dataset is comprised completely of license free data. The Fire Station dataset and the EMS dataset were merged into one working file. TGS processed as one file and then separated for delivery purposes.

Census tracts are not legal boundaries, but are considered stable geographic units used for the presentation of decennial census data. The following is excerpted from an Adobe Acrobat PDF document named TGRSHP2011_TECHDOC.PDF (U.S. Census Bureau): Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and are reviewed and updated by local participants prior to each decennial census as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau updates census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where local or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people with an optimum size of 4,000 people. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tracts are delineated with the intention of being maintained over a long time so that statistical comparisons can be made from census to census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some states and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses.

Generally, census blocks are small in area; for example, a block in a city. Census blocks in suburban and rural areas may be large, irregular, and bounded by a variety of features, such as roads, streams, and/or transmission line rights-of-way. In remote areas census blocks may encompass hundreds of square miles. Census blocks cover all territory in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island areas. A block may consist of one or more faces. Blocks never cross county or census tract boundaries (See Figures 3 and 4). They do not cross the boundaries of any entity for which the Census Bureau tabulates data, including American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian areas, congressional districts, county subdivisions, places, state legislative districts, urbanized areas, urban clusters, school districts, voting districts, or ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) or some special administrative areas such as military installations, and national parks and monuments.

Most block groups were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau delineated block groups only where a local or tribal government declined to participate or where the Census Bureau could not identify a potential local participant. A block group usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one block group and block groups are uniquely numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, block groups never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian areas. Block groups have a valid range of 0 through 9. Block groups beginning with a 0 generally are in coastal and Great Lakes water and territorial seas. Rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the three-mile territorial sea limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census trac boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore.

TrueWind has also produced data files of the predicted wind speed frequency distribution and speed and energy by direction. The maps and data files are provided on a CD with the ArcReader software, which will enable users to view, print, copy, and query the maps and wind rose data. The MesoMap system consists of an integrated set of atmospheric simulation models, databases, and computers and storage systems. At the core of MesoMap is MASS (Mesoscale Atmospheric Simulation System), a numerical weather model, which simulates the physics of the atmosphere. MASS is coupled to a simpler wind flow model, WindMap, which is used to refine the spatial resolution of MASS and account for localized effects of terrain and surface roughness. MASS simulates weather conditions over a region for 366 historical days randomly selected from a 15-year period. When the runs are finished, the results are input into WindMap. In this project, the MASS model was run on a grid spacing of 1.7 km and WindMap on a grid spacing of 200 m. The wind maps show that the best wind resource in Indiana is found in the northcentral part of the state. The mean wind speed at 50 m height between Indianapolis, Kokomo, and Lafayette, and to the northwest of Lafayette, is predicted to be in the range of 6.5 to 7 m/s, and the mean wind power is predicted to be about 250 to 350 W/m2, or NREL class 2 to 3. In the rest of northern Indiana, the wind speed tends to be around 0.5 m/s lower, and the wind power is a solid class 2. In southern Indiana, a wind speed of 4.5 to 6 m/s and a wind power class of 1 to 2 prevails. The main reason for this wind resource distribution pattern is that the land is much more forested in the southern half of the state than in the northern half. Topography also plays a role, as does the track of the jet stream.","[u'TrueWind Solutions, LLC (data creator)', u'Indiana Department of Commerce (data provider)', u'Denver Harper (metadata creator)', u'Michael Brower (data creator)', u'Indiana Geological Survey (metadata creator)', u'Chris Dintaman (metadata creator)', u'National Renewable Energy Laboratory (data creator)']",[u'Indiana Geological Survey'],Public,Purdue,"{""http://schema.org/downloadUrl"":""http://maps.indiana.edu/download/Environment/Wind_Power_50m.zip"",""urn:x-esri:serviceType:ArcGIS#DynamicMapLayer"":""https://maps.indiana.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Environment/Wind_Power_50m/MapServer"",""http://schema.org/url"":""http://maps.indiana.edu/layerGallery.html"",""http://www.isotc211.org/schemas/2005/gmd/"":""http://64.90.181.107/geonetwork/srv/api/records/df5d321c-09c8-4977-8645-bf7812625606/formatters/xml""}",,df5d321c-09c8-4977-8645-bf7812625606,Raster,2017-12-27T20:51:06Z,Shapefile,English,Dataset,"[u'Climatology, Meteorology and Atmosphere', u'Wind power']",IndianaMAP,9/5/07,2007,"[u'Indiana, United States', u'Tippecano County, Indiana, United States', u'Wabash River, Indiana, United States']","ENVELOPE(-88.68757, -84.223033, 42.086677, 37.434122)","39.7603995,-86.4553015",2007

These data, which are estimates produced under the Census Bureau's Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) program, were then incorporated into a preexisting shapefile showing school districts in Indiana, as of 2000. Data that were obtained for each school district included total population of each district, population of relevant children (ages 5 to 17), and number of children from families in poverty. A new field, giving the percentage of children in each district that are from families in poverty, was calculated by dividing the number of children in poverty by the population of relevant children. The SAIPE data were produced for school districts as they existed in 2005-2006. It was not possible to find a boundary file for school districts in those years, so a boundary file for 2000 was used. In a few areas, it was not possible to match the SAIPE data with the 2000 school-district boundaries. This is presumably the result of changes (such as mergers or divisions) of school districts between 2000 and 2006. Regarding the preexisting shapefile showing school districts, the following is excerpted from an online document produced by the U.S. Census Bureau pertaining to unified school districts (found at http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cob/sd_metadata.html): School districts are geographic entities within which state, county, or local officials provide public educational services for the area's residents. The U.S. Census Bureau obtains the boundaries and names for school districts from state officials. The U.S. Census Bureau first provided data for school districts in the 1970 census. For Census 2000, the U.S. Census Bureau tabulated data for three types of school districts: elementary, secondary, and unified. Each school district is assigned a five-digit code that is unique within state. School district codes are assigned by the Department of Education and are not necessarily in alphabetical order by school district name.","[u'Denver Harper (Data processor)', u'United States Department of Commerce, United States Census Bureau (Data creator)', u'Indiana Geological Survey (Data processor)']",[u'Indiana Geological Survey (IGS)'],Public,Purdue,"{""http://schema.org/downloadUrl"":""http://maps.indiana.edu/download/Demographics/Population_Children_Poverty.zip"",""urn:x-esri:serviceType:ArcGIS#DynamicMapLayer"":""https://maps.indiana.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Demographics/Population_Children_Poverty/MapServer"",""http://schema.org/url"":""http://maps.indiana.edu/layerGallery.html"",""http://www.isotc211.org/schemas/2005/gmd/"":""http://64.90.181.107/geonetwork/srv/api/records/f5f07783-172e-492f-83cf-50a5e67d32d9/formatters/xml""}",,f5f07783-172e-492f-83cf-50a5e67d32d9,Mixed,2017-12-27T20:50:44Z,Shapefile,English,Dataset,"[u'Society', u'Boundaries', u'Census', u'Demographics', u'Schools', u'Population']",IndianaMAP,4/26/07,2007,"[u'Indiana, United States', u'West Lafayette, Indiana, United States']","ENVELOPE(-88.0972, -84.6884, 41.7734, 37.7606)","39.767,-86.3928",2007

TrueWind has also produced data files of the predicted wind speed frequency distribution and speed and energy by direction. The maps and data files are provided on a CD with the ArcReader software, which will enable users to view, print, copy, and query the maps and wind rose data. The MesoMap system consists of an integrated set of atmospheric simulation models, databases, and computers and storage systems. At the core of MesoMap is MASS (Mesoscale Atmospheric Simulation System), a numerical weather model, which simulates the physics of the atmosphere. MASS is coupled to a simpler wind flow model, WindMap, which is used to refine the spatial resolution of MASS and account for localized effects of terrain and surface roughness. MASS simulates weather conditions over a region for 366 historical days randomly selected from a 15-year period. When the runs are finished, the results are input into WindMap. In this project, the MASS model was run on a grid spacing of 1.7 km and WindMap on a grid spacing of 200 m. The wind maps show that the best wind resource in Indiana is found in the northcentral part of the state. The mean wind speed at 50 m height between Indianapolis, Kokomo, and Lafayette, and to the northwest of Lafayette, is predicted to be in the range of 6.5 to 7 m/s, and the mean wind power is predicted to be about 250 to 350 W/m2, or NREL class 2 to 3. In the rest of northern Indiana, the wind speed tends to be around 0.5 m/s lower, and the wind power is a solid class 2. In southern Indiana, a wind speed of 4.5 to 6 m/s and a wind power class of 1 to 2 prevails. The main reason for this wind resource distribution pattern is that the land is much more forested in the southern half of the state than in the northern half. Topography also plays a role, as does the track of the jet stream.","[u'TrueWind Solutions, LLC (data creator)', u'Indiana Department of Commerce (data provider)', u'Denver Harper (metadata creator)', u'Michael Brower (data creator)', u'Indiana Geological Survey (metadata creator)', u'Chris Dintaman (metadata creator)', u'National Renewable Energy Laboratory (data creator)']",[u'Indiana Geological Survey'],Public,Purdue,"{""http://schema.org/downloadUrl"":""http://maps.indiana.edu/download/Environment/Wind_Speed_50m.zip"",""urn:x-esri:serviceType:ArcGIS#DynamicMapLayer"":""https://maps.indiana.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Environment/Wind_Speed_50m/MapServer"",""http://schema.org/url"":""http://maps.indiana.edu/layerGallery.html"",""http://www.isotc211.org/schemas/2005/gmd/"":""http://64.90.181.107/geonetwork/srv/api/records/b8205929-ebfc-4ed5-8475-f1e75cc97222/formatters/xml""}",,b8205929-ebfc-4ed5-8475-f1e75cc97222,Raster,2017-12-27T20:51:07Z,Shapefile,English,Dataset,"[u'Climatology, Meteorology and Atmosphere', u'Wind power']",IndianaMAP,9/5/07,2007,"[u'Indiana, United States']","ENVELOPE(-88.68757, -84.223033, 42.086677, 37.434122)","39.7603995,-86.4553015",2007

The Census Bureau obtains school district boundaries, names, local education agency codes, grade ranges, and school district levels biennially from state school officials. The Census Bureau collects this information for the primary purpose of providing the U.S. Department of Education with annual estimates of the number of children in poverty within each school district, county, and state. This information serves as the basis for the Department of Education to determine the annual allocation of Title I funding to states and school districts. The 2013 TIGER/Line Shapefiles include separate shapefiles for elementary, secondary, and unified school districts. The 2013 shapefiles contain information from the 2012-2013 school year. The 2012-2013 school districts represent districts in operation as of January 1, 2013. The elementary school districts provide education to the lower grade/age levels and the secondary school districts provide education to the upper grade/age levels. The unified school districts are districts that provide education to children of all school ages. In general, where there is a unified school district, no elementary or secondary school district exists (see exceptions described below), and where there is an elementary school district the secondary school district may or may not exist (see explanation below). The U.S. Census Bureau's Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) program provides annual estimates of income and poverty statistics for all school districts, counties, and states. The main objective of this program is to provide estimates of income and poverty for the administration of federal programs and the allocation of federal funds to local jurisdictions.

"dc_description_s": "EARTHQUAKE_LIQUEFACTION_IN is a point shapefile that shows sites where paleoliquefaction features have been identified in the field by Pat Munson of the Indiana Geological Survey and by archeologists of the Department of Anthropology, Indiana University, Bloomington. The ages of the features, which were determined by radiocarbon dating, dating of associated archaeological artifacts, and flood plain stratigraphy are all within 20,000 years before present.",

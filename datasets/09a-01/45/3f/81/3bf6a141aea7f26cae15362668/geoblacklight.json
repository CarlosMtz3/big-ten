"dc_description_s": "COAL_AVAILABILITY_SPRINGFIELD_IN_THICKNESS is a polygon shapefile giving thickness (in feet) of the Springfield Coal Member in Indiana. COAL_AVAILABILITY_SPRINGFIELD_IN_THICKNESS was extracted from COAL_AVAILABILITY_SPRINGFIELD_IN. COAL_AVAILABILITY_SPRINGFIELD_IN identifies those resources of the Springfield Coal Member in Indiana which have favorable geologic and land use characteristics for surface and underground mining, as well as those which have unfavorable geologic and land use characteristics for surface and underground mining. In addition, COAL_AVAILABILITY_SPRINGFIELD_IN describes the geology of the Springfield Coal, including coal thickness, coal depth, and stripping ratio.",

  "dc_description_s": "The following is excerpted from an on-line document produced by ESRI pertaining to the Census 2000 TIGER Line data:  \"The Census 2000 TIGER/Line shapefiles were created from the Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) database of the United States Census Bureau.  The shapefiles contain data about the following features:  Line Featuresroads, railroads, hydrography, and transportation and utility lines.  Boundary Featuresstatistical (e.g., census tracts and blocks); government (e.g., places and counties); and administrative (e.g., congressional and school districts).  Landmark Featurespoint (e.g., schools and churches); area (e.g., parks and cemeteries); and key geographic locations (e.g., apartment buildings and factories).  The shapefiles do not contain:  Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs).  Current address range information as reflected in the Master Address File (MAF).  Corrections to naming of some geographic entities, including voting districts and school districts, and attributes such as Place Description Codes (PLACEDC) and Legal/Statistical Area Description Codes (LSADC).  This updated Census information for the 2000 TIGER/Line files is available from the U.S. Census Bureau at the following web site url: http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/tiger2k/tgr2000.html The U.S. Census Bureau also provides GENERALIZED cartographic boundary files for many of their geographies. These cartographic boundary files can be downloaded by state, in shapefile format (.shp), as well as ArcInfo export files (.e00).\"",

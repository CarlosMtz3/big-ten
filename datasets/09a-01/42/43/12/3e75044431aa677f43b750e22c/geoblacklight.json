The following is excerpted from metadata provided with the original source data set named IN_USNG_UTM16.SHP: This is a polygon feature data layer of United States National Grid (1000 m x 1000 m polygons) constructed by the Center for Interdisciplinary Geospatial Information Technologies at Delta State University with support from the US Geological Survey under the Cooperative Agreement 07ERAG0083. For correct display, please set the base coordinate system and projection such that it matches the UTM zone for which these data were constructed using the NAD 83 datum. Further information about the US National Grid is available from http://www.fgdc.gov/usng and a viewing of these layers as applied to local geography may be seen at the National Map, http://www.nationalmap.gov .",

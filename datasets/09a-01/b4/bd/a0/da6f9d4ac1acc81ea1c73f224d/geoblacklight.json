"dc_description_s": "HYDROGRAPHY_LOCALRES_FLOWLINE_NHD_IN.SHP is a line shapefile that contains streams, rivers, canals, ditches, artificial paths, coastlines, connectors and pipelines in watersheds in and around Indiana. HYDROGRAPHY_LOCALRES_FLOWLINE_NHD_USGS.SHP is derived from the local-resolution version of the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD), and is current as of August 6, 2015. PLEASE NOTE - New stream/river features added as part of this project (i.e., not in the predecessor high-resolution NHD) were not assigned an FCode of perennial, intermittent or ephemeral. They will have a generic Stream/River FCode (46000). Water may or may not be present outside of rain events and may or may not exhibit channelization typically associated with streams. This dataset is currently incomplete but includes data for the following twenty-nine HUC08 subbasins in Indiana: Auglaize (0410007), Blue-Sinking (05140104), Driftwood (05120204), Eel (05120104), Eel (05120203), Flatrock-Haw (05120205), Iroquois (07120002), Lower East Fork White (05120208), Lower Great Miami (05080002), Lower Ohio-Little Pigeon (05140201), Lower Wabash (05120113), Lower White (05120202), Middle Wabash-Busseron (05120111), Middle Wabash-Deer (05120105), Mississinewa (05120103), Muscatatuck (05120207), Patoka (05120209), Salamonie (05120102), St. Joseph (04050001), St. Joseph-Maumee (04100003), St. Marys (04100004), Sugar (05120110), Upper East Fork White (05120206), Upper Great Miami (05080001), Upper Maumee (04100005), Upper White (05120201), Vermillion (05120109), Whitewater (05080003), Wildcat (05120107). The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USGS for the local-resolution NHD feature class named NHD_LOCALRES_FLOWLINE_IN: The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.",

These comparisons have been shown to drive energy\u00a0efficiency upgrades and increase occupancy rates and property values. The District of\u00a0Columbia has chosen U.S. EPA\u2019s free DDOE is required to publicly disclose the ENERGY STAR\u00ae\u00a0Benchmarking results for each privately owned building that is subject to the benchmarking\u00a0law For more\u00a0informationdc.gov/energybenchmarking.PurposeThis data is used by the District\u00a0[For 2012 File:] 2012 energy and water benchmarking data is being disclosed for privately\u00a0owned buildings over 150",

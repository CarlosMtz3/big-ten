This data represents the potential flood extent for a stage of 11-ft to 37-ft as recorded at the Harrisburg (Susquehanna River at Harrisburg, PA; USGS ID 01570500) river gage. This data is part of a series of inundation layers meant to correlate observations and forecasts from the river gage with a visual representation of the areas impacted by high water. The data set of flood inundation areas was created from flood scenarios generated by HEC-RAS runs provided by USACE-Baltimore and LiDAR data from PASDA processed to extract bare earth points. A shapefile of inundation area for each stage was created and subsequently merged to form continuous datasets for the main-stem Susquehanna River and backwater areas on its tributaries.This data was developed to assist the public and emergency officials with planning and response to high water episodes at or near a defined National Weather Service river forecast point.",

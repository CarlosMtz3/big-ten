They show the height of ground above Mean Sea Level (M.S.L.). Numerous contour lines that are close together indicate hilly or mountainous terrain; when far apart, they represent a gentler slope. This data set consists of breaklines, mass points, and contours at a five foot interval for the 5-county, Pennsylvania portion of DVRPC's region in ESRI Personal Geodatabase format (Pennsylvania State Plane coordinate system, NAD83).",

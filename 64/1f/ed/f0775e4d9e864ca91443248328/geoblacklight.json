A predecessor shapefile, named EFEMERG, was obtained by the Indiana Geological Survey (IGS) from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS). EFEMERG was included on a CD-ROM (titled HAZUS99, Central US) that is the product of a program referred to as HAZUS, The FEMA Tool for Estimating Earthquake Losses. The original shapefile has been modified by personnel of the IGS. This metadata was created by personnel of IGS, using information included in the HAZUS user's manuals. Data for the predecessor shapefile was obtained from a FEMA Database (1996) (HAZUS99, Technical and User Manuals, Appendices.pdf, Appendix D, Summary of Inventory Databases).",

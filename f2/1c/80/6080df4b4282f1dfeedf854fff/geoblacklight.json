The Maryland coastal zone extends from three miles out in the Atlantic Ocean to the inland boundaries of the 16 counties and Baltimore City that border the Atlantic Ocean, Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac River up to the District of Columbia. This area encompasses two-thirds of the States land area and is home to almost 70% of Marylands residents.Feature Service Layer Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Hydrology/MD_Watersheds/FeatureServer/4",

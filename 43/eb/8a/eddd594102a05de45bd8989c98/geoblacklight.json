The layers are:City - Local FundingCity - Federal FundingStateData Development:These layers were created through the use of a query layer within ArcGIS ArcMap. We accessed our Paving Database and created a spatial layer of the data by connecting our paving data which is in a SQL database to the City's Street Centerline layer to give the Paving data spatial context.Other options for displaying this data would be to base it off the ProjectNumber, ProjectName, or BidNumber fields. Other InformationKeep in mind the three layers you are seeing here are copies of one another and the only difference is the definition query, so each layer is based off of 1 of the 3 different funding options. In order to get a view of all the data, make sure you remove the definition query and/or append the 3 layers together in your own arcmap environment",

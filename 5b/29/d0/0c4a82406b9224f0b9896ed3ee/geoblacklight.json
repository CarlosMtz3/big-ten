Conservation values were determined by experts gathered by the United Stated Forest Service Pennsylvania Highlands Study. Slopes 15% - 25% were assigned a value of 2 and slopes greater then 25% were assigned a value of 4. Conservation values were determined by experts gathered by Natural Lands Trust through SmartConservation. This data set is one of several that have been combined to create an overall terrestrial resources conservation value raster for the expanded piedmont ecoregion. Therefore the values were determined as a relative rank, comparable in value only to the other input terrestrial resources data. Conservation value ranges from 1 - 10 with 10 being the highest value.",

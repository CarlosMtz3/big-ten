"dc_description_s": "An Industrial Mineral Mining Operation is a DEP primary facility type related to the Industrial Mineral Mining Program. The sub-facility types are listed below:__________Deep Mine Underground mining of industrial minerals, i.e., noncoal mining. Includes, but is not limited to, industrial minerals extracted from beneath the surface by means of shafts, tunnels, adits, or other mine openings. Discharge Point Discharge of water from an area as a result of industrial mining activities, i.e., noncoal mining. Mineral Preparation Plant Facility at which industrial minerals (i.e., noncoal minerals) are cleaned and processed. Mining Stormwater GP - General permit for Stormwater discharges associated with industrial mineral mining activities in which the main pollutant is sediment. Discharge is not into a High Quality or Exceptional Value designated stream. Surface Mine Surface mining of industrial minerals (i.e., noncoal minerals) by removing material which lies above the industrial minerals. Includes, but is not limited to, strip, auger, quarry, dredging, and leaching mines.",

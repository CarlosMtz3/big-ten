A predecessor shapefile of HOSPITAL, named EFCARE, was obtained by the Indiana Geological Survey (IGS) from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS). The shapefile was included on a CD-ROM (titled arcHAZUS99, Central US) that is the product of a program referred to as HAZUS, The FEMA Tool for Estimating Earthquake Losses. The original shapefile (referred to as EFCARE.SHP) has been modified by personnel of the IGS. These metadata were created by personnel of IGS, using information included in the HAZUS user's manuals. Data for the predecessor shapefile was obtained from an AHA Database (1999) (HAZUS99, Technical and User Manuals, Appendices.pdf, Appendix D, Summary of Inventory Databases.)",

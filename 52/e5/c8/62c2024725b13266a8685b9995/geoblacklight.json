"dc_description_s": "The Blue Infrastructure study area and extent of inventory data was defined as the 16 coastal zone counties (Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Calvert, Caroline, Cecil, Charles, Dorchester, Harford, Kent, Prince George's, Queen Anne's, Somerset, St. Mary's, Talbot, Wicomico, and Worcester) and Baltimore City. Including Baltimore City makes a total of 17 designated locations based on sixteen County Boundaries and one City Boundary. Four main models were created to perform the overlay processes to calculate the Zonal Majority used to determine the total rank for all the segments. The Blue Infrastructure assessment was designed as a spatial evaluation of coastal habitat, critical natural resources and associated human uses in the tidal waters and near-shore areas of Maryland's coastal zone. The Assessment is used to identify near-shore tidal habitat priority areas that support coastal habitats and the resources and economies that depend upon them. The Blue Infrastructure was developed through a partnership between the Maryland Department of Natural Resources' Chesapeake and Coastal Program, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Towson University's Center for GIS.Last Updated: 5/1/2010Feature Service Layer Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Hydrology/MD_BlueInfrastructure/FeatureServer/0",

"dc_description_s": "The data in these six files is derived from Wellogic, theMichigan Department of Environmental Quality statewide ground water database. The six files combined contain information on over575,000 spatially verified water well records.The six files are intended to provide water well information for wellsin counties clustered by geographic region: Upper Peninsula, Northern LowerPeninsula, East Central Lower Peninsula, West Central Lower Peninsula,Southwest Lower Peninsula and the South Central  Southeastern Lower Peninsula. The files are constructed to be easilymerged, containing the same number and type of attribute fields.;Although the derived data in these files represents thebest readily available data, the six files do not represent a complete databaseof all wells or well records in existence. Until January 1, 2000 not all water wellrecords for new wells in Michigan were entered into Wellogic. For wells drilled before 2000 the rate ofinclusion is highly variable from one county to another. Further, there is a quality control check onlocation that may exclude a limited number of wells from Wellogic from the sixfiles made available on this site.More Metadata;",

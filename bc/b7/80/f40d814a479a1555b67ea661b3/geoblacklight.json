The Minnesota Geospatial Information Office created the initial CTU dataset by updating a municipal boundary file maintained by the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT). Update information was gathered primarily from annexation and detachment records maintained by the Office of Administrative Hearings, Municipal Boundary Adjustment Unit. MnDOT has maintained the file since 2014. Note: Townships represented in this dataset are political (civil) townships, not public land survey townships, and unorganized territory subdivisions are those defined by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, which often differ from those defined by a county.",

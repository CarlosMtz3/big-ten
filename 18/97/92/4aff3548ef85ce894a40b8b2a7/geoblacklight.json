The spreadsheets used included 06acadlib.xls (academic libraries), plmail2006.xls (public libraries), and plbranch2006.xls (public branch libraries). Using street addresses from the downloaded spreadsheets, shapefiles were created using the Geocoding tool in ESRI ArcMap 9.2 and street information licensed from Tele Atlas, Dynamap/2000, v. 17.0. The shapefiles were then merged using the Merge tool in ESRI ArcToolbox.",

"dc_description_s": "userdata and unzip the LayerFiles.zip folder.Data from the four SSURGO tables were assembled into the single table included in each map package. Data from the component table were aggregated using a dominant component model (listed below under Component Table  Dominant Component) or a weighted average model (listed below under Component Table  Weighted Average) using custom Python scripts. The the Mapunit table, the MUAGATTAT table and the processed Component table data were joined to the Mapunit Feature Class. Field aliases were added and indexes calculated. A field named Map Symbol was created and populated with random integers from 1-10 for symbolizing the soil units in the map package.For documentation of the SSURGO dataset see:http://soildatamart.nrcs.usda.gov/SSURGOMetadata.aspxFor documentation of the Watershed Boundary Dataset see: http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/water/watersheds/datasetThe map packages contain the following attributes in the Map Units layer:Mapunit Feature Class:Survey AreaSpatial VersionMapunit SymbolMapunit KeyNational Mapunit SymbolMapunit Table:Mapunit NameMapunit KindFarmland ClassHighly Erodible Lands Classification -

This data set is not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool in permitting or citing decisions, but may be used as a reference source. This is public information and may be interpreted by organizations, agencies, units of government, or others based on needs; however, they are responsible for the appropriate application. Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to reassign to the Natural Resources Conservation Service any authority for the decisions that they make. The Natural Resources Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these maps for purposes related solely to State or local regulatory programs. Photographic or digital enlargement of these maps to scales greater than at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation of the data. If enlarged, maps do not show the small areas of contrasting soils that could have been shown at a larger scale. The depicted soil boundaries, interpretations, and analysis derived from them do not eliminate the need for onsite sampling, testing, and detailed study of specific sites for intensive uses. Thus, these data and their interpretations are intended for planning purposes only. Digital data files are periodically updated. Files are dated, and users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the data.The attribute accuracy is tested by manual comparison of the source with hard copy plots and/or symbolized display of the map data on an interactive computer graphic system. Selected attributes that cannot be visually verified on plots or on screen are interactively queried and verified on screen. In addition, the attributes are tested against a master set of valid attributes. All attribute data conform to the attribute codes in the signed classification and correlation document and amendment(s).Last Updated:Feature Service Layer Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Geoscientific/MD_SSURGOSoils/MapServer/0",

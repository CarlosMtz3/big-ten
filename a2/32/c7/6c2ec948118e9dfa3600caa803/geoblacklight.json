NRun-of-the-River damN is a manmade structure which: is regulated or permitted by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) pursuant to the act of November 26,1978 (P.L.1375, No.325), known as the Dam Safety and Encroachments Act; is built across a river or stream for the purposes of impounding water where the impoundment at normal flow levels is completely within the banks and all flow passes directly over the entire dam structure within the banks, excluding abutments, to a natural channel downstream; and DEP determines to have hydraulic characteristics such that at certain flows persons entering the area immediately below the dam may be caught in the backwash.",

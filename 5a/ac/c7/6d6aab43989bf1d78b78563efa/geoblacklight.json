The complete citation for the paper map is: Map of the Glacial Deposits of Northwestern Pennsylvania by V.C. Shepps, J.B. Droste, and R.F. Sitler under the supervision of G.W.White, 1959, Bulletin G-32, Pennsylvania Geologic Survey. The original map was published at a scale of 1:125,000. Three counties are fully covered by these deposits and mapped (Crawford, Erie, and Mercer); five more are partially covered and mapped (Beaver, Butler, Lawrence, Warren, and Venango). This GIS data set shows the areal distribution of 14 distinct glacial deposits from the Pleistocene Epoch and Recent stream alluvium and/or bedrock exposures. All mapping activity and lithologic interpretations were made by the original authors of the map (Shepps et al., 1959); the authors of this electronic geospatial resource (Shaffer et al., 2005) have only provided digital transfer of the map features and attributes and documentation of the process.",

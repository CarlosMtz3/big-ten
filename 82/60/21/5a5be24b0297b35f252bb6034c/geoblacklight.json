The most restrictive shrink-swell characteristic of the soil layer was used to represent the component soil. The component soil values were then assigned to a map unit based on the percentage of that component soil in the map unit. A category was calculated for the map unit based on the most restrictive category at the 70th percentile of the map unit.",

The Composite Opportunity Index uses publicly - available data and is based on three major factors: community health, economic opportunity, and educational opportunity. To be designated a Community of Opportunity, and mapped as such to the Maryland QAP Comprehensive Opportunity Maps, the community must have a Composite Opportunity Index that it is above the statewide average.

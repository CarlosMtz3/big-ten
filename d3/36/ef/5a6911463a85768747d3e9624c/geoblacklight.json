"dc_description_s": "Transit-oriented development (TOD) is an approach to land use planning and development which promotes the efficient use of land and transportation infrastructure. TODs are generally higher density developments comprising a mix of residential, office, commercial, and civic uses in a pedestrian friendly environment within walking distance of a transit center. In 2008 the Maryland legislature adopted a formal definition for TOD as Na dense, mixed-use, deliberately planned development within a half-mile of transit stations that is designed to increase transit ridershipN.Last Updated: 12/2015Feature Service Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/BusinessEconomy/MD_IncentiveZones/FeatureServer/11",

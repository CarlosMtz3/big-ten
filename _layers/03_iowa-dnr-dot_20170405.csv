This list is supplemental to Iowa DOT's primary focus, Iowa's 5 Percent Safety Report. To develop this list, all crashes in Iowa are used to determine an initial cut of intersections that meet the criteria of at least one crash. The intersections identified are then ranked according to the number of crashes, the severity of the crashes, and the rate at which crashes occur. To read more details regarding Iowa's SICL, see Iowa SICL method. The Iowa DOT utilizes crash reports filed by city police departments, county sheriffs, the Iowa State Patrol and individual drivers in determining the listings. The locations identified are eligible for funding assistance to develop safety improvements under the Iowa Traffic Safety Fund Program. Grant applications for funding are competitive and subject to comparison with the 5 percent severe safety needs list. The Iowa DOT will select proposals that provide the greatest safety return on the dollars invested. Proposals must be submitted to the Iowa DOT by June 15th each year to qualify for funding the following year. The Iowa Transportation Commission will consider and approve funding for selected locations during November and December.

Point features were created using aerial imagery. Check out the Statewide Park and Ride System application, found on the Iowa DOT Interactive Map Portal.The Iowa Department of Transportation s park and ride system consists of state-owned park and ride lots. Many of these lots were developed during the 1980s, primarily in response to a growing demand that resulted from an increase in fuel prices. In most cases, lot development was truly the result of grassroots efforts, with Iowa DOT s district offices often responding to specific public requests for park and ride facilities.As a part of the plan this database was created to geographically reference both existing state-owned park and ride facilities and ideal candidates for future expansion of the system. This database will also be used in coordination with the statewide rideshare program, so it will also include other existing park and ride facilities not owned by the state or identified in the plan. Ultimately this inventory has two main purposes that can be described generally as internal and external. Internally, the database will be used to keep track of state-owned inventory and identify opportunities for the expansion of the state-owned and operated park and ride system. Externally, the database will be expanded to include a wide array of park and ride facilities across the state of Iowa that can be disseminated to the public via the Iowa DOT website and coordinated with the rideshare program.",2016-06-15,2016,[u'Iowa Department of Transportation'],58f82337-3847-426c-aca9-d27a3028486e,,40.7057 -96.5113 43.4534 -96.5113 43.4534 -90.4629 40.7057 -90.4629 40.7057 -96.5113,2016,[u'Iowa DOT Open Data Portal'],StatewideParkandRideSystem_shp,40.7057 -96.5113 43.4534 -90.4629,Statewide Park and Ride System: Iowa,Shapefile,"[u'Iowa, United States']",Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT),58f82337-3847-426c-aca9-d27a3028486e,Dataset,

The Iowa DOT's Office of Traffic and Safety has updated a list of the top 1000 intersection safety improvement candidate locations (SICL) in Iowa. This list is supplemental to Iowa DOT's primary focus, Iowa's 5 Percent Safety Report. To develop this list, all crashes in Iowa are used to determine an initial cut of intersections that meet the criteria of at least one crash. The intersections identified are then ranked according to the number of crashes, the severity of the crashes, and the rate at which crashes occur. To read more details regarding Iowa's SICL, see Iowa SICL method. The Iowa DOT utilizes crash reports filed by city police departments, county sheriffs, the Iowa State Patrol and individual drivers in determining the listings. The locations identified are eligible for funding assistance to develop safety improvements under the Iowa Traffic Safety Fund Program. Grant applications for funding are competitive and subject to comparison with the 5 percent severe safety needs list. The Iowa DOT will select proposals that provide the greatest safety return on the dollars invested. Proposals must be submitted to the Iowa DOT by June 15th each year to qualify for funding the following year. The Iowa Transportation Commission will consider and approve funding for selected locations during November and December.

The Iowa DOT's Office of Traffic and Safety has updated a list of the top 1000 intersection safety improvement candidate locations (SICL) in Iowa. This list is supplemental to Iowa DOT's primary focus, Iowa's 5 Percent Safety Report. To develop this list, all crashes in Iowa are used to determine an initial cut of intersections that meet the criteria of at least one crash. The intersections identified are then ranked according to the number of crashes, the severity of the crashes, and the rate at which crashes occur. To read more details regarding Iowa's SICL, see Iowa SICL method. The Iowa DOT utilizes crash reports filed by city police departments, county sheriffs, the Iowa State Patrol and individual drivers in determining the listings. The locations identified are eligible for funding assistance to develop safety improvements under the Iowa Traffic Safety Fund Program. Grant applications for funding are competitive and subject to comparison with the 5 percent severe safety needs list. The Iowa DOT will select proposals that provide the greatest safety return on the dollars invested. Proposals must be submitted to the Iowa DOT by June 15th each year to qualify for funding the following year. The Iowa Transportation Commission will consider and approve funding for selected locations during November and December.

Identifies number of crashes and injuries on a county by county basis going back to 2001. The Iowa DOT's Office of Traffic and Safety has updated a list of the top 1000 intersection safety improvement candidate locations (SICL) in Iowa. This list is supplemental to Iowa DOT's primary focus, Iowa's 5 Percent Safety Report. To develop this list, all crashes in Iowa are used to determine an initial cut of intersections that meet the criteria of at least one crash. The intersections identified are then ranked according to the number of crashes, the severity of the crashes, and the rate at which crashes occur. To read more details regarding Iowa's SICL, see Iowa SICL method. The Iowa DOT utilizes crash reports filed by city police departments, county sheriffs, the Iowa State Patrol and individual drivers in determining the listings. The locations identified are eligible for funding assistance to develop safety improvements under the Iowa Traffic Safety Fund Program. Grant applications for funding are competitive and subject to comparison with the 5 percent severe safety needs list. The Iowa DOT will select proposals that provide the greatest safety return on the dollars invested. Proposals must be submitted to the Iowa DOT by June 15th each year to qualify for funding the following year. The Iowa Transportation Commission will consider and approve funding for selected locations during November and December.

Identifies number of crashes and injuries on a city by city basis going back to 2001. The Iowa DOT's Office of Traffic and Safety has updated a list of the top 1000 intersection safety improvement candidate locations (SICL) in Iowa. This list is supplemental to Iowa DOT's primary focus, Iowa's 5 Percent Safety Report. To develop this list, all crashes in Iowa are used to determine an initial cut of intersections that meet the criteria of at least one crash. The intersections identified are then ranked according to the number of crashes, the severity of the crashes, and the rate at which crashes occur. To read more details regarding Iowa's SICL, see Iowa SICL method. The Iowa DOT utilizes crash reports filed by city police departments, county sheriffs, the Iowa State Patrol and individual drivers in determining the listings. The locations identified are eligible for funding assistance to develop safety improvements under the Iowa Traffic Safety Fund Program. Grant applications for funding are competitive and subject to comparison with the 5 percent severe safety needs list. The Iowa DOT will select proposals that provide the greatest safety return on the dollars invested. Proposals must be submitted to the Iowa DOT by June 15th each year to qualify for funding the following year. The Iowa Transportation Commission will consider and approve funding for selected locations during November and December.

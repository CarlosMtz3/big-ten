This project started with the release of Census 2010 geography and population totals to all 72 Wisconsin counties on March 21st2011. Census Geography and population totals to be used for local redistricting were made available on the Wisconsin Shape Editor for Local Redistricting (WISE-LR) website (http://legis.wisconsin.gov/wiselr/) and the WISE-LR web application located at http://wiselr.legis.wisconsin.gov. The 180 day statutory timeline for local redistricting to occur in Wisconsin ended on September 19th, 2011. Wisconsin Legislative and congressional redistricting plans were enacted in the fall of 2011. 2011 Wisconsin Act 43 and Act 44 created new Assembly, Senate and Congressional lines for the state. These new districts were created using Census 2010 block geography. Some municipal wards that were created before Act 43 and 44 were enacted, which created municipal wards in some communities to be split between assembly, senate and congressional districts. 2011 Wisconsin Act 39allowed communities to divide wards affected, along census blocks. Newly formed wards created under Wisconsin Act 39 would need named using alpha-numeric labels (ward 1 divided by an assembly district would become ward 1A and ward 1B, or the next sequential ward number would have to be used, ward 1 and ward 2). The process of dividing wards under Act 39 ended on April 10th, 2012.

The Wisconsin Land Cover Grid is a raster representation of land cover derived from Landsat satellite imagery. The source data were acquired from the nationwide MRLC (Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium) acquisition of dual-date Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data primarily from 1992. The image processing technique followed was published in the UMGAP Image Processing Protocol (1998).The original pixel size of the source TM data is 30 meters, however the classified WISCLAND Land Cover data (excluding URBAN) are generalized or 'smoothed' to an area no smaller than four contiguous pixels (equivalent to approximately one acre). The result of this smoothing is that any feature five acres or larger may be resolved in the data (i.e., Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) of five acres). The Land Cover data are usable at nominal scales of 1:40,000 to 1:500,000 for a wide variety of resource management and planning applications.

It is a feature class within the geodatabase, Brown_Parcels_2015.gdb. [TaxParcel depicts parcels of land as polygon features. Attributes include ParcelType, ParcelID, LegalLabel, MapAreaTxt, CSM, Lot, Municipality and more. The ParcelType is a subtype code which indicates whether a parcel polygon is a regular Tax Parcel or if it's a Condominium. Condominiums are currently mapped as overlapping (stacked) polygons so that a 1:1 join can be used to link up tax assessment records with the parcel. For other areas of land where records are ambiguous and ownership is uncertain, ParcelType may show Gap, Overlap or Undetermined. In some areas, private roadways, public road rights-of-way, and railroad rights-of-way are also coded. ParcelID is the parcel identification number which can be used to relate or join the TaxParcel polygon to assessment records and other information. In the GeoDatabase version of this dataset, the ParcelID is set up as a 1:M Relate to various tables within the geodatabase to link ownership, tax information, assessment, and more. LegalLabel depicts the document of record that CREATED or MODIFIED the shape of the parcel (this document reference does NOT necessarily show the latest document of record (the latest document of record number is instead obtained through the joined/related table in the DocID field). The document numbers on the LegalLabel as well as the DocID number in the related table can be used to look up the deed or other document recorded in the Brown County Register of Deeds office. MapAreaTxt is the size of the parcel, generally the size recorded on the plat, CSM or other legal document. The format follows that shown on the legal document (which may be square feet -- SF -- or Acreage). If the parcel was recently created using a Certified Survey Map (CSM) then that CSM number may be recorded in the ParcelPolygon attributes, which is graphically feature-linked to the CSM text annotation on the map. Lot numbers for some of the recent parcels may also be held as an attribute. The Lot Number is based on the lot shown on the source subdivision plat or CSM. Please refer to the LotNumber annotation feature class, as this text layer contains many more lot numbers. The Lot attribute field in this parcel polygon layer is primarily used to generate feature-linked text on the map for newly-created lots. Please keep in mind that lots are often split, merged and otherwise changed from their original shape and size. In these cases, the legally-recorded lot does not change in size or shape, but the TaxParcel polygon does. MashedWorld is a computed field used to view the parcel from the Google StreetView and Microsoft Virtual Earth perspectives. Created_User and Created_Date fields in TaxParcel polygons tracks the GIS editor who digitized the parcel and the date it was digitized (NOT necessarily the date the parcel was recorded!).

USGS developed processing methods to filter production artifacts in the existing data, convert to the NAD83 datum, edge-match, and fill slivers of missing data at quadrangle seams. One of the effects of the NED processing steps is a much-improved base of elevation data for calculating slope and hydrologic derivatives. The specifications for the NED 1 arc second (30 meter) and 1/3 arc second (10 meter) data are: Geographic coordinate system Horizontal datum of NAD83, except for AK which is NAD27; Vertical datum of NAVD88, except for AK which is NAVD29 Z units of meters",2008-12-28,2009,[u'Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources'],2284f2f3-a943-4701-a5e8-6bba88a92e0d,,42.317034 -93.169512 47.218179 -93.169512 47.218179 -86.460605 42.317034 -86.460605 42.317034 -93.169512,2009,[u'Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources'],2284f2f3-a943-4701-a5e8-6bba88a92e0d,42.317034 -93.169512 47.218179 -86.460605,"NED 10m Hillshade Image, Wisconsin 2009",GeoTIFF,"[u'Wisconsin, United States']",Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR),2284f2f3-a943-4701-a5e8-6bba88a92e0d,Dataset,

Land cover was classified via supervised classification at the native 30 m resolution. The map has a two acre minimum mapping unit, meaning that the smallest feature depicted in the map is approximately nine pixels in size. The land cover data are best utilized at approximate map scales of 1:48,000 to 1:500,000, and at no less than a 2 acre minimum mapping unit (MMU).

This project started with the release of Census 2010 geography and population totals to all 72 Wisconsin counties on March 21st2011. Census Geography and population totals to be used for local redistricting were made available on the Wisconsin Shape Editor for Local Redistricting (WISE-LR) website (http://legis.wisconsin.gov/wiselr/) and the WISE-LR web application located at http://wiselr.legis.wisconsin.gov. The 180 day statutory timeline for local redistricting to occur in Wisconsin ended on September 19th, 2011. Wisconsin Legislative and congressional redistricting plans were enacted in the fall of 2011. 2011 Wisconsin Act 43 and Act 44 created new Assembly, Senate and Congressional lines for the state. These new districts were created using Census 2010 block geography. Some municipal wards that were created before Act 43 and 44 were enacted, which created municipal wards in some communities to be split between assembly, senate and congressional districts. 2011 Wisconsin Act 39 allowed communities to divide wards affected, along census blocks. Newly formed wards created under Wisconsin Act 39 would need named using alpha-numeric labels (ward 1 divided by an assembly district would become ward 1A and ward 1B, or the next sequential ward number would have to be used, ward 1 and ward 2). The process of dividing wards under Act 39 ended on April 10th, 2012.

The dataset is primarily derived from remote sensing imagery acquired by the Landsat 5, 7, and 8 satellites between 2010 and 2014. Land cover was classified via supervised classification at the native 30 m resolution. The map has a two acre minimum mapping unit, meaning that the smallest feature depicted in the map is approximately nine pixels in size. The land cover data are best utilized at approximate map scales of 1:48,000 to 1:500,000, and at no less than a 2 acre minimum mapping unit (MMU). Overall accuracy for the Level 3 classification is estimated at 73% across all classes.

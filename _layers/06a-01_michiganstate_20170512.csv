The DNR website has details and a wide variety of accessible, ADA compliant rules, guidelines and features and (see webpage http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-153-10366_41825---,00.html and subpage on hunting / wildlife information at http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-153-10366_41825_51108---,00.html ).  Users may require only walking assistance devices or may be those with specific wheelchairs, personal assistive mobility devices (PAMDs), or other motorized-type vehicles.   Please check rules for specific rules, regulations, and restrictions as they relate to what equipment might be used, before using such equipment, as not all equipment legal on public places, residential or commercial buildings, or such are allowed on all areas of Michigan s public land managed by the DNR.     Accessible features on State Wildlife/Game Area include those which have low-slope, no stairs or steps along features, and are accessible for wheelchairs, or personal assistive mobility devices (PAMDs). All buildings, DNR Shooting-Ranges, and other permanent public use structures are fully ADA compliant and accessible. It is the more natural features being identified in this layer. Many of these features are fully ADA code compliant (which is ~1 inch rise or less over 12 inch distances) and are regularly checked for obstructions, while other features comply with the low-slope requirements or are identified as such so they are not over-represented to a lower or no slope level. In natural rustic areas it can be difficult to maintain these slope limits and to clearing check for naturally-occurring obstructions like leaves, sticks or other naturally occurring items which blow or wash onto trails or outside features. Therefore, features are frequently identified as no-slope or low-slope/PAMD levels and not over-represented as fully ADA compliant.      The DNR Wildlife Division is in a updated state-wide review to identify features and provide better information on accessible features, such as by GIS compatible layers provided here. Accessible features typically include accessible combinations of parking, a trail and a destination location like a platform or blind location; read the attribute fields like the comment field, for details on what is at the provided data point, line or polygon. Although available for use by anyone, it's hoped consideration for use will be given to those individuals that have limited mobility, please, for use of these accessible parking, trails, blinds or platforms, and other features. Patience is appreciated for local site conditions which might be caused by weather, wind or rain, wildlife or other public users; please report any problems with features to either the local DNR Wildlife office or the main DNR Wildlife help options (e-mail DNR-Wildlife@michigan.gov , or call 517-284-9453).",2016-10-27,2016-2017,[u'Michigan DNR'],1783b83a-0d18-4a8d-b63b-2f9b68116ac4,,43.277888 -84.118362 43.345502 -84.118362 43.345502 -84.092401 43.277888 -84.092401 43.277888 -84.118362,2016,,1783b83a-0d18-4a8d-b63b-2f9b68116ac4,43.277888 -84.118362 43.345502 -84.092401,Low-slope/PAMD accessible trails: Michigan,Shapefile,"[u'Michigan, United States']",State of Michigan Open Data Portal,1783b83a-0d18-4a8d-b63b-2f9b68116ac4,Dataset,

The six files combined contain information on over575,000 spatially verified water well records.The six files are intended to provide water well information for wellsin counties clustered by geographic region: Upper Peninsula, Northern LowerPeninsula, East Central Lower Peninsula, West Central Lower Peninsula,Southwest Lower Peninsula and the South Central  Southeastern Lower Peninsula. The files are constructed to be easilymerged, containing the same number and type of attribute fields.Although the derived data in these files represents thebest readily available data, the six files do not represent a complete databaseof all wells or well records in existence.

The baseflow of a stream or river is the amount of groundwater discharged from an aquifer to the watercourse. This discharge occurs year-round, and fluctuates seasonally depending on the level of the water in the aquifer. Baseflow is supplemented by direct runoff during and immediately after precipitation or melt events, resulting in peaks on a hydrograph showing stream flow through time. The process of dividing these peaks into base flow and runoff is called hydrograph separation. Hydrograph separations were completed for all USGS stream- flow gaging stations in Michigan that had more than 10 years of daily records. Sites that were clearly affected by upstream impoundments (lakes, dams) were excluded. No attempt was made to detect or correct for trends in the data. This may lead to some errors in the comparison of streams with data from different time periods if there is an underlying temporal trend in the data, but inclusion of all records in the analysis was necessary to increase the data pool and provide better spatial coverage. Watersheds were delineated for each of the 208 stream-flow gaging stations, and various characteristics of each watershed, such as topographic relief, surficial geology, land cover, growing degree days, annual and winter-season precipitation, and others were tabulated. Regression modeling, described in the Technical Report, was used to estimate the baseflow for each steam segment of the 1:100,000-scale National Hydrography Dataset.",,2015,[u'State of Michigan'],dc4e84eb-1006-4229-8843-79201c00944a,,41.2769 -90.3951 47.4692 -90.3951 47.4692 -82.4174 41.2769 -82.4174 41.2769 -90.3951,2015,[u'State of Michigan GIS Open Data'],dc4e84eb-1006-4229-8843-79201c00944a,41.2769 -90.3951 47.4692 -82.4174,"Base Flow of Michigan Streams: Michigan, 2015",Shapefile,"[u'Michigan, United States']",State of Michigan Open Data Portal,dc4e84eb-1006-4229-8843-79201c00944a,Dataset,

A Coal Mining Operation is a DEP primary facility type related to the Mining Program.

Discharge Point Discharge of water from an area as a result of coal mining activities. Mineral Preparation Plant Facility at which coal is cleaned and processed. NPDES Discharge Point is an effluent discharge at a coal mine operation permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true. Through advances in predictive science, less than 2 percent of the permits issued today result in a post-mining discharge. New technologies, including alkaline addition and special handling of acid producing material, are being studied in order to help address the remaining 2 percent.

The then-available physiographic provinces map was compiled by the Survey at 1:500,000 scale and published at 1:2,000,000 scale in 1989. A new physiographic provinces map was recompiled on county 1:50,000-scale topographic maps having 20-foot contour intervals. Boundaries based primarily on geology were positioned using published geological maps. Most boundaries were positioned by topographic interpretation. The use of a 20-foot contour interval (a 200-foot interval was used in 1989) resulted in the repositioning of some boundaries. New scale-enhanced understanding of topographic/geologic patterns in the Appalachian Plateaus province resulted in the creation of three new sections and the revision of other section boundaries. The new compilation was reduced 50 percent and transferred to 1:100,000-scale mylar base maps. The province and section boundaries and the late Wisconsinan glacial border were digitized from the mylars, edgematched, assembled into a single dataset, and attributed with physiographic province and section names using UNIX-based Arc/Info. The late Wisconsinan glacial border, which coincides with province and section boundaries in some places, was copied to a separate dataset and removed from the dataset containing the province and section boundaries. There are two datasets for the late Wisconsinan glacial border and the physiographic province and section boundaries. The original datasets are accurate at 1:100,000 scale. The other datasets have been generalized to 1:500,000-scale accuracy for more regional work.

The wells are broken into two formation types of conventional and unconventional wells. A conventional well is a bore hole drilled or being drilled for the purpose of or to be used for the production of oil or natureal gas from only conventional formation(s). A conventional formation is any formation that does not meet the statutory definition of an unconventional formation. An unconventional gas well is a bore hole drilled or being drilled for the purpose of or to be used for the production of natural gas from an unconventional formation. Unconventional formation is a geological shale formation existing below the base of the Elk Sandstone or its geologic equivalent stratigraphic interval where natural gas generally cannot be produced at economic flow rates or in economic volumes except by vertical or horizontal well bores stimulated by hydraulic fracture treatments or by using multilateral well bores or other techniques to expose more of the formation to the well bore.

County-wide karst-feature inventories for fourteen counties (Adams, Berks, Bucks, Centre, Chester, Cumberland, Dauphin, Franklin, Lancaster, Lebanon, Lehigh, Montgomery, Northampton, and York) were originally released as hard-copy open file reports by the agency. The user of this dataset would be well served to consult one of those reports for specifics on how the inventories were conducted. Data are also provided from incidental reports of karst features as well as partial or cursory inventories in eight additional counties (Bedford, Blair, Clinton, Fulton, Huntingdon, Juniata, Lycoming, and Mifflin). The majority of these features were identified on contact prints of USDA, USGS, and other aerial photography. Photo locations were then transferred to paper copies of USGS 7.5 minute quadrangles where the coordinates for the locations were determined using a constantly evolving array of technologies from mylar overlay grids, through early proprietary mapping software and more recently with GIS and GPS technology. . Some features in urbanized areas were identified via questionaires that were sent to the municipalities in the counties being inventoried. The locations of surface mines and cave entrances were garnered from historical geological publicatons. Locations of historical iron mines and other activities often associated with karst features were garnered from historical geological publications. Field surveys were undertaken to establish protocol for future mapping efforts as well as to verify the field presence of interpreted features. Field verified sites are not identified in the data set. Karst features change considerablely over time. Sinkholes become filled or subsidence is repaired. One of the motivations for the karst inventory program was the rapid development taking place in many of the counties where karst could be a problem.

One of the primary goals of the project is to generate a current, consistent, seamless, and accurate National Land cover Database (NLCD) circa 2001 for the United States at medium spatial resolution. This landcover map and all documents pertaining to it are considered NprovisionalN until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted. For a detailed definition and discussion on MRLC and the NLCD 2001 products, refer to Homer et al. (2004) and http://www.mrlc.gov/mrlc2k.asp. The NLCD 2001 is created by partitioning the U.S. into mapping zones. A total of 66 mapping zones were delineated within the conterminous U.S. based on ecoregion and geographical characteristics, edge matching features and the size requirement of Landsat mosaics.

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 52 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 104 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 84 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2005). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Total personal income is all the income that is received by, or on behalf of, the residents of a particular area. It is calculated as the sum of wage and salary disbursements, other labor income, proprietors' income with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments, rental income of persons with capital consumption adjustment, personal dividend income, personal interest income, and transfer payments to persons, minus personal contributions for social insurance. Per capita personal income is calculated as the total personal income of the residents of a county divided by the resident population of the county. The Census Bureau's annual midyear population estimates were used in the computation. The average annual number of full-time and part-time jobs includes all jobs for which wages and salaries are paid, except jury and witness service and paid employment of prisoners. The jobs are counted at equal weight, and employees, sole proprietors, and active partners are all included. Unpaid family workers and volunteers are not included. Average wage per job is the wage and salary disbursements divided by the number of wage and salary jobs in the county. Wage and salary disbursements consist of the monetary remuneration of employees, including the compensation of corporate officers; commissions, tips, and bonuses; and receipts in kind, or pay-in-kind, such as the meals furnished to the employees of restaurants. It reflects the amount of payments disbursed, but not necessarily earned during the year.

The following tasks were performed under this scope of work: A GPS-corrected GIS grid analysis for each quadrangle was completed and is accompanied by documentation that describes procedures and provides metadata of the informational content of the GIS. A high-resolution global positioning system (GPS) survey was conducted for each topographic quadrangle in order to evaluate and correct systematic discrepancies in elevation between the modern and historic surveys.

The tiling format of NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. The NAIP imagery is formatted to the UTM coordinate system using the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile. This file was generated by compressing NAIP imagery that cover the county extent. Two types of compression may be used for NAIP imagery: MrSID and JPEG 2000.

Then click the NView Regions & BlocksN link, select a block, click its NBlock MapN tab and choose whether to print an air photo or a topo map. This site can be used to help you find the particular 2nd PBBA block where you live or where you make any of your breeding bird observations. You can zoom directly to a point by entering a latitude and longitude. Be sure to use decimal degree format and always include a minus (-) sign before the longitude. Or, you can type in a street address. Be sure to enter both the address and the associated zip code. When you click NRefresh Map,N the point or address you entered will be shown as a yellow circle on the map within the Atlas block, which is outlined with green lines and identified with a small number, such as 62B43. The ability to locate 2nd PBBA blocks for a specific lat/long is very helpful, for example, if you have been hiking or boating through an area covering several Atlas blocks, all the while collecting waypoints to go along with breeding bird sightings that you make.

Total personal income is all the income that is received by, or on behalf of, the residents of a particular area. It is calculated as the sum of wage and salary disbursements, other labor income, proprietors' income with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments, rental income of persons with capital consumption adjustment, personal dividend income, personal interest income, and transfer payments to persons, minus personal contributions for social insurance. Per capita personal income is calculated as the total personal income of the residents of a county divided by the resident population of the county. The Census Bureau's annual midyear population estimates were used in the computation. The average annual number of full-time and part-time jobs includes all jobs for which wages and salaries are paid, except jury and witness service and paid employment of prisoners. The jobs are counted at equal weight, and employees, sole proprietors, and active partners are all included. Unpaid family workers and volunteers are not included. Average wage per job is the wage and salary disbursements divided by the number of wage and salary jobs in the county. Wage and salary disbursements consist of the monetary remuneration of employees, including the compensation of corporate officers; commissions, tips, and bonuses; and receipts in kind, or pay-in-kind, such as the meals furnished to the employees of restaurants. It reflects the amount of payments disbursed, but not necessarily earned during the year. Per capita number of jobs is calculated as the average annual number of full-time and part-time jobs in a county divided by the resident population of the county. The Census Bureau's annual midyear population estimates were used in the computation. All dollar estimates are in current dollars, not adjusted for inflation.

This land cover dataset is part of a one-time series in which ten Mid-Atlantic States were categorized based on the extensive field observations collected during the 2002 annual NASS June Agricultural Survey. No farmer reported data is included or derivable from the Cropland Data Layer. The area of coverage for the 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL includes the entire states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and West Virginia. The funding for this project was shared between the USDA-NASS and Towson State University. The 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL is currently a special one-time project. However, the possibility does exist to establish an annual cropland data layer for any state that shows significant interest and can offer an in-state cooperative agreement with another federal, state, local, or university agency or group. If interested, please contact the Section Head of the USDA-NASS Spatial Analysis Research Section at 703/877-8000.

The user must have a firm understanding of how the datasets were compiled and the resulting limitations of these data. The National Land Cover Dataset was compiled from Landsat satellite TM imagery (circa 1992) with a spatial resolution of 30 meters and supplemented by various ancillary data (where available). The analysis and interpretation of the satellite imagery was conducted using very large, sometimes multi-state image mosaics (i.e. up to 18 Landsat scenes). Using a relatively small number of aerial photographs for 'ground truth', the thematic interpretations were necessarily conducted from a spatially-broad perspective. Furthermore, the accuracy assessments (see below) correspond to 'federal regions' which are groupings of contiguous states. Thus, the reliability of the data is greatest at the state or multi-state level. The statistical accuracy of the data is known only for the region. Important Caution Advisory With this in mind, users are cautioned to carefully scrutinize the data to see if they are of sufficient reliability before attempting to use the dataset for larger-scale or local analyses. This evaluation must be made remembering that the NLCD represents conditions in the early 1990s. The Pennsylvania portion of the NLCD was created as part of land cover mapping activities for Federal Region III that includes the States of Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. The NLCD classification contains 21 different land cover categories with a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The NLCD was produced as a cooperative effort between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) to produce a consistent, land cover data layer for the conterminous U.S. using early 1990s Landsat thematic mapper (TM) data purchased by the Multi-resolution Land Characterization (MRLC) Consortium.

Total personal income is all the income that is received by, or on behalf of, the residents of a particular area. It is calculated as the sum of wage and salary disbursements, other labor income, proprietors' income with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments, rental income of persons with capital consumption adjustment, personal dividend income, personal interest income, and transfer payments to persons, minus personal contributions for social insurance. Per capita personal income is calculated as the total personal income of the residents of a county divided by the resident population of the county. The Census Bureau's annual midyear population estimates were used in the computation. The average annual number of full-time and part-time jobs includes all jobs for which wages and salaries are paid, except jury and witness service and paid employment of prisoners. The jobs are counted at equal weight, and employees, sole proprietors, and active partners are all included. Unpaid family workers and volunteers are not included. Average wage per job is the wage and salary disbursements divided by the number of wage and salary jobs in the county. Wage and salary disbursements consist of the monetary remuneration of employees, including the compensation of corporate officers; commissions, tips, and bonuses; and receipts in kind, or pay-in-kind, such as the meals furnished to the employees of restaurants. It reflects the amount of payments disbursed, but not necessarily earned during the year.

Layer inculde groundwater basin shapefiles include - river basins, MCD's, census blocks, sewage treament outfalls, water use, study area, dry stream valley systems, geology, karst modified uplands, impervious surfaces, wetlands. JPEG maps include study area, basins, withdraws, conductivity, nitrates, geology, water tables, flowlines, mapplate. Achieving a balance among environmental, human, and economic needs in the management of the basin?s water resources is a critical mission of the Susquehanna River Basin Commission (Commission), as described in the 1971 Susquehanna River Basin Compact (Compact). The Commission carries out its water resource management responsibilities in a number of ways through its regulatory program, public education and information, and resource evaluation. In areas of intense water resource utilization, the Commission may conduct special studies, water budget analyses, and identify critical aquifer recharge areas (CARAs). The Commission, in partnership with the Lancaster County Conservation District (LCCD), performed a groundwater resources evaluation of a carbonate valley located in northern Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The project was funded by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) through its Growing Greener Grant Program. The study area includes an isolated carbonate aquifer of 50 square miles and a surrounding siliciclastic contributing area of 20 square miles. Parts of 13 municipalities, including the Boroughs of Manheim, Lititz, Akron, Ephrata, and Denver, are located in the study area. Groundwater is the primary source of water for municipal, domestic, industrial, and agricultural uses. As groundwater withdrawals increase to meet growing demands, stakeholders need information on the location and quantity of water resources available, and how to best develop, conserve, and protect them. Removal of groundwater resources faster than the sustainable rate could lead to a growing water deficit, the gradual failure of water supplies, diminishing stream and spring flows, and degraded aquatic and riparian habitat. Project participants involved the local public during the course of the study through a Water Budget Advisory Committee (WBAC) and educational workshops. Important resource areas are identified, and management recommendations for these areas are provided in this report. The study area has experienced rapid growth. From 1990 to 2000, several municipalities in the study area exceeded Lancaster County?s growth rate of 11.3 percent. Warwick Township, located in the Manheim?Lititz groundwater basin, experienced the highest growth rate of 33.2 percent. Anticipated growth and development in the study area are expected to result in 2 increased water demand. Population projections from 2000 through 2025 represent a 26 percent increase. Historic changes in land use have led to increased impervious areas, increased stormwater runoff, and reduced infiltration. Impervious cover was 9 percent of the 70-squaremile study area. This potentially reduces average annual recharge by 1,575 million gallons in the study area. When one considers the carbonate areas of the Manheim-Lititz and Ephrata area groundwater basins, 12.6 percent and 8 percent of these areas are impervious, respectively. The focus of the study is a valley approximately 50 square miles in area, underlain by a highly productive carbonate aquifer, and herein informally termed the ?carbonate valley.? The carbonate valley is surrounded almost entirely by hills underlain by aquifers of much lower permeability (Figure 2). The carbonate valley includes parts of the Chiques Creek, Cocalico Creek, and Lititz Run watersheds. Streams generally flow from north to south across the study area, with the exception of the largest stream, Cocalico Creek, which flows from northeast to southwest. The study area includes parts of 8 townships and 5 boroughs, and had a population of approximately 61,000 in the year 2000. Water supply needs are met almost entirely by groundwater. The valley was once largely agricultural, but is rapidly changing to a mosaic of urban, suburban, and agricultural areas. The population in the carbonate valley is rapidly growing, as is the need for water. However, the amount of water available is limited. Most of the groundwater is derived from the carbonate aquifer that underlies the valley. The presence of sinkholes, abundant closed depressions, large springs, and lack of streams in many areas suggests that dissolution of the carbonate bedrock, a condition known as karst, has substantially enhanced the ability of the aquifer to store and transmit water. Karst aquifers are known for their abundant water resources and extremely high well yields, as well as their hard water, enigmatic flow patterns, sinkholes, and high susceptibility to contamination.",2005-09-02,2005,[u'Susquehanna River Basin Commission (SRBC)'],2ee70803-ce48-4019-ab0a-90ab5b2b3462,,40.148497 -76.312562 40.252479 -76.312562 40.252479 -76.098432 40.148497 -76.098432 40.148497 -76.312562,2005,,2ee70803-ce48-4019-ab0a-90ab5b2b3462,40.148497 -76.312562 40.252479 -76.098432,"Northern Lancaster County Groundwater Study: Pennsylvania, 2005",File,"[u'Pennsylvania, United States']",Pennsylvania Spatial Data Access (PASDA),2ee70803-ce48-4019-ab0a-90ab5b2b3462,Dataset,

The assessment included the main stem, tributaries and small headwater streams.

The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). One of the primary goals of the project is to generate a current, consistent, seamless, and accurate National Land Cover Database (NLCD) circa 2001 for the United States at medium spatial resolution. For a detailed definition and discussion on MRLC and the NLCD 2001 products, refer to Homer et al. (2003) and http://www.mrlc.gov/mrlc2k.asp. The NLCD 2001 was created by partitioning the U.S. into mapping zones. A total of 66 mapping zones were delineated within the conterminous U.S. based on ecoregion and geographical characteristics, edge matching features and the size requirement of Landsat mosaics. Mapping zone 60 encompasses whole or portions of several states including New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Questions about the NLCD mapping zone 60 can be directed to the NLCD 2001 land cover mapping team at the USGS/EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.",2003-09-01,1999-2001,[u'U.S. Geological Survey'],11f9c7fb-7667-48d7-8a59-510103b9ef03,,35.78466 -78.124012 40.81651 -78.124012 40.81651 -73.849718 35.78466 -73.849718 35.78466 -78.124012,1999,[u'U.S. Geological Survey'],11f9c7fb-7667-48d7-8a59-510103b9ef03,35.78466 -78.124012 40.81651 -73.849718,"National Land Cover Database 2001 - Imperviousness Layer: Pennsylvania and Northeast, 2003",File,"[u'Pennsylvania, United States']",Pennsylvania Spatial Data Access (PASDA),11f9c7fb-7667-48d7-8a59-510103b9ef03,Dataset,

The date actually is a mid-point as the remotely sensed and ancillary data are representative of the time period 2003-2007.

No farmer reported data is included or derivable from the Cropland Data Layer. The area of coverage for the 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL includes the entire states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and West Virginia.

These data were produced by MDA Federal Inc., under contract to the USGS and were derived from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper satellite imagery. Each of the four datasets consists of 16 land use and land cover classes (Anderson, et al., 1976). The datasets are temporally comparable and encompass the entire Chesapeake Bay watershed and most intersecting counties. The 2001 dataset represents the base layer for the Data Series and is composed of NOAA's 2001 Coastal Change Analysis Program (CCAP) dataset in the coastal and northern portion of the watershed coupled with USGS' 2001 National Land Cover Dataset in the western and southwestern portions of the watershed. MDA Federal's Cross Correlation Analysis (CCA) technique was used to produce updates (yr. 2006) and retrospective updates (yrs. 1984 and 1992) to the base layer. CCA identifies significant spectral changes between image pairs within the range of spectral values for each land cover class identified in the 2001 base layer. MDA Federal used Classification and Regression Trees to assign land cover classes to 1984, 1992, and 2006 pixels exhibiting significant deviations from their 2001 expected spectral values. MDA Federal used these methods to develop the 1996 and 2005 land cover change datasets for the Mid-Atlantic coastal area funded by NOAA CCAP. Land use and land cover interpretations derived from Landsat satellite imagery are based on the sun's reflectance off the land surface, e.g., urban areas have different spectral reflectance characteristics than forests and herbaceous vegetation. For this reason, the data most accurately represent land cover (e.g., tree canopy) compared with land use or management (e.g., forests and pasture). Due to similarities in spectral reflectance characteristics, some land use and land cover classes are easily confused with each other. The spectral characteristics of low density residential areas, for example, may closely resemble the characteristics of forests in a neighborhood with mature trees or of cropland or pasture if large residential lots are composed mostly of lawns. Cropland and pasture may also have similar spectral qualities. Therefore, users should be cautioned against evaluating transitions between cropland and pasture based on the CBLCD. Users should be generally confident, however, that the overall spatial patterns of cropland and pasture in the Bay watershed are accurate because the USGS and NOAA used multi-season imagery to create the 2001 base layer and the data compare favorably with county-level cropland and pasture acreage estimates reported in the 2002 U.S. Census of Agriculture. The USGS is in the process of interpreting and publishing statistics on the extent, type, and patterns of land cover change from 1984-2006 in the Bay watershed, major tributaries, and counties. The USGS will also be publishing land change forecasts based on observed trends in the CBLCD. These additional interpretations, statistics, and datasets will be publicly released over the coming year following publication.",1992-01-01,1992,[u'U.S. Geological Survey'],963a2351-81be-4dd9-89df-6177563a8edf,,36.180919 -81.146651 44.591052 -81.146651 44.591052 -73.299775 36.180919 -73.299775 36.180919 -81.146651,1992,,963a2351-81be-4dd9-89df-6177563a8edf,36.180919 -81.146651 44.591052 -73.299775,"Chesapeake Bay Watershed Land Cover Data Series 1992: Chesapeake Bay, 1992",File,"[u'Chesapeake Bay, United States']",Pennsylvania Spatial Data Access (PASDA),963a2351-81be-4dd9-89df-6177563a8edf,Dataset,

In addition, the USPS frequently realigns, merges or splits ZIP codes to meet changing needs. ZCTAs are constructed by aggregating the Census 2000 blocks whose addresses use a given ZIP code.

The date actually is a mid-point as the remotely sensed and ancillary data are representative of the time period 2003-2007.

The imagery was collected between April 24, 2002 and September 12, 2002. The approximate scale is 1:100,000 with a ground resolution of 30 meters by 30 meters. The CDL emphasis is on agricultural land cover. The area of coverage is the entire State of New Jersey This land cover dataset is part of a one-time series in which ten Mid-Atlantic States were categorized based on the extensive field observations collected during the 2002 annual NASS June Agricultural Survey. No farmer reported data is included or derivable from the Cropland Data Layer. The area of coverage for the 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL includes the entire states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and West Virginia. The funding for this project was shared between the USDA-NASS and Towson State University. The 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL is currently a special one-time project. However, the possibility does exist to establish an annual cropland data layer for any state that shows significant interest and can offer an in-state cooperative agreement with another federal, state, local, or university agency or group. If interested, please contact the Section Head of the USDA-NASS Spatial Analysis Research Section at 703/877-8000.

The ZCTAs are generalized area representation of the USPS Zip code service areas, but are not the same as Zip codes. There is no correlation between ZIP codes and Census Bureau geography. In addition, the USPS frequently realigns, merges or splits ZIP codes to meet changing needs. ZCTAs are constructed by aggregating the Census 2000 blocks whose addresses use a given ZIP code. The census bureau took the ZIP code used by the majority of addresses in each census unit at the time the data was compiled.

The purpose of the TMDL program is to identify sources of pollution and allocate pollutant loads in places where water quality goals are not being achieved. This layer shows the list of waters for which technology-based or other required pollution controls are not stringent enough to meet water quality standards. The TMDLs themselves specify a pollutant budget that must be achieved to meet state water quality standards and allocates pollutant loads among pollution sources in a watershed, e.g., point and nonpoint sources. This layer represents lakes with TMDL associated with them. Lakes have characteristics that differentiate TMDLs from other waters. Lakes are not free-flowing like streams, but are contained waters that trap pollutants for long periods. Most lake impairments are from high nutrient or sediment loads. Wherever possible, lake TMDLs are developed with the information in the lake study reports that were sponsored by local watershed groups or other local interests. Target acceptable pollutant loads are set at the level of a watershed largely unaffected by human induced impacts. Load allocations are given to the pollutant sources using the same methods as nonpoint source TMDLs. Other indicators of water quality are also considered in the evaluation of a lake. One indicator is the Trophic Status Index (TSI), which refers to the degree of nutrient enrichment in the lake. Nutrient enrichment causes growths of algae that consume oxygen and interfere with the health of the aquatic organisms in the lake. The TSI is affected by factors such as lake volume, water residence time and nutrient loads to the lake. After target loads are set, the TSI is evaluated under reduced nutrient load conditions to assure that the pollutant reductions will bring the TSI into an acceptable range. Implementation of lake TMDLs is best accomplished though local participation. This layer is based on the High Resolution National Hydrography Dataset (NHD).",2016-04-01,2016,[u'Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection'],eb95eb32-eb2a-4337-9dbf-4562d3cf73c7,,40.003513 -80.531309 41.663657 -80.531309 41.663657 -74.744705 40.003513 -74.744705 40.003513 -80.531309,2016,[u'Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection'],eb95eb32-eb2a-4337-9dbf-4562d3cf73c7,40.003513 -80.531309 41.663657 -74.744705,"Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) Lakes: Pennsylvania, 2016",File,"[u'Pennsylvania, United States']",Pennsylvania Spatial Data Access (PASDA),eb95eb32-eb2a-4337-9dbf-4562d3cf73c7,Dataset,

The imagery was collected between April 24, 2002 and September 12, 2002. The approximate scale is 1:100,000 with a ground resolution of 30 meters by 30 meters. The CDL emphasis is on agricultural land cover. The area of coverage is the entire State of New York This land cover dataset is part of a one-time series in which ten Mid-Atlantic States were categorized based on the extensive field observations collected during the 2002 annual NASS June Agricultural Survey. No farmer reported data is included or derivable from the Cropland Data Layer. The area of coverage for the 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL includes the entire states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and West Virginia. The funding for this project was shared between the USDA-NASS and Towson State University. The 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL is currently a special one-time project. However, the possibility does exist to establish an annual cropland data layer for any state that shows significant interest and can offer an in-state cooperative agreement with another federal, state, local, or university agency or group.

Composting is a process that biologically decomposes organic waste under controlled anaerobic or aerobic conditions to yield a humus-like product. Land Application: Includes facilities that uses agricultural utilization or land reclamation of waste. Sewage sludge is land-applied for its nutrient value or as a soil conditioner. Landfill - Abandoned: The Abandoned Landfill Inventory Project collects geospatial and descriptive data for closed and abandoned landfills throughout the state of Pennsylvania. Locations for sites were determined from historic records such as microfiche, index card, topographic map, and staff personal files, and then compiled into site lists. Each of the six DEP regions is staffed with summer interns who physically locate the sites and collect the data for the project. The purpose of the Abandoned Landfill Inventory Project is to determine the location of abandoned and closed landfills in order to catalog potential environmental hazards. The data is intended for internal government and public consumption, in order to keep property sales, clean-up efforts, and land development well informed. For metadata on the ALI Project, see Abandonded Landfill Metadata. Landfill: A landfill is a facility that uses land for the disposal of municipal waste. Processing Facility: A processing facility is a transfer station, composting facility, resource recovery facility, or a facility that reduces the volume or bulk of municipal waste for offsite reuse. Resource Recovery: A resource recovery is a facility that provides for the extraction and utilization of materials or energy from municipal waste. The facility can be a mechanical extraction facility or a combustion facility.

The then-available physiographic provinces map was compiled by the Survey at 1:500,000 scale and published at 1:2,000,000 scale in 1989. A new physiographic provinces map was recompiled on county 1:50,000-scale topographic maps having 20-foot contour intervals. Boundaries based primarily on geology were positioned using published geological maps. Most boundaries were positioned by topographic interpretation. The use of a 20-foot contour interval (a 200-foot interval was used in 1989) resulted in the repositioning of some boundaries. New scale-enhanced understanding of topographic/geologic patterns in the Appalachian Plateaus province resulted in the creation of three new sections and the revision of other section boundaries. The new compilation was reduced 50 percent and transferred to 1:100,000-scale mylar base maps. The province and section boundaries and the late Wisconsinan glacial border were digitized from the mylars, edgematched, assembled into a single dataset, and attributed with physiographic province and section names using UNIX-based Arc/Info. The late Wisconsinan glacial border, which coincides with province and section boundaries in some places, was copied to a separate dataset and removed from the dataset containing the province and section boundaries. There are two datasets for the late Wisconsinan glacial border and the physiographic province and section boundaries. The original datasets are accurate at 1:100,000 scale. The other datasets have been generalized to 1:500,000-scale accuracy for more regional work. A companion dataset consisting of the state and county boundaries of Pennsylvania was compiled from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 1:100,000-scale digital-line-graph (DLG) files for boundaries.

Total personal income is all the income that is received by, or on behalf of, the residents of a particular area. It is calculated as the sum of wage and salary disbursements, other labor income, proprietors' income with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments, rental income of persons with capital consumption adjustment, personal dividend income, personal interest income, and transfer payments to persons, minus personal contributions for social insurance. Per capita personal income is calculated as the total personal income of the residents of a county divided by the resident population of the county. The Census Bureau's annual midyear population estimates were used in the computation. The average annual number of full-time and part-time jobs includes all jobs for which wages and salaries are paid, except jury and witness service and paid employment of prisoners. The jobs are counted at equal weight, and employees, sole proprietors, and active partners are all included. Unpaid family workers and volunteers are not included. Average wage per job is the wage and salary disbursements divided by the number of wage and salary jobs in the county. Wage and salary disbursements consist of the monetary remuneration of employees, including the compensation of corporate officers; commissions, tips, and bonuses; and receipts in kind, or pay-in-kind, such as the meals furnished to the employees of restaurants. It reflects the amount of payments disbursed, but not necessarily earned during the year. Per capita number of jobs is calculated as the average annual number of full-time and part-time jobs in a county divided by the resident population of the county.

The aerial LiDAR was acquired at a point density average of 1-meter with final products comprised of LAS (ground and above ground points). The aerial LiDAR was collected during leaf-off conditions during the fall 2012 flying season (November). The LiDAR is being delivered as a project area wide dataset, consisting of 2,500' x 2,500' tiles (which matches the ortho tiling system). Adjacent flight lines overlap by an average of 30 percent. LiDAR was collected with Leica ALS LiDAR Systems. The file naming convention is as follows: xxxyyy (Pennsylvania North Zone); Please note that xxx and yyy represent the easting and northing coordinates (respectively) in state plane feet. Each LiDAR file is approximately 40 megabytes in size. Ownership of the data products resides with Penn State and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. The LiDAR data will be utilized for the rectification of aerial imagery to produce 1=100 scale ortho-imagery with a 6-inch pixel resolution. The LiDAR data will also be used as a component during the future delineation of project area wide impervious surfaces (using remote sensing techniques). FINAL DELIVERABLES: The final deliverables are listed below. The final LiDAR data was delivered in a State Plane projection tiling format, based on a modular layout. The tiles were clipped to eliminate overlap between adjacent tiles. The 2500 feet x 2500 feet tile file name was derived from the lower left coordinates of each tile.

These data were produced by MDA Federal Inc., under contract to the USGS and were derived from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper satellite imagery. Each of the four datasets consists of 16 land use and land cover classes (Anderson, et al., 1976). The datasets are temporally comparable and encompass the entire Chesapeake Bay watershed and most intersecting counties. The 2001 dataset represents the base layer for the Data Series and is composed of NOAA's 2001 Coastal Change Analysis Program (CCAP) dataset in the coastal and northern portion of the watershed coupled with USGS' 2001 National Land Cover Dataset in the western and southwestern portions of the watershed. MDA Federal's Cross Correlation Analysis (CCA) technique was used to produce updates (yr. 2006) and retrospective updates (yrs. 1984 and 1992) to the base layer. CCA identifies significant spectral changes between image pairs within the range of spectral values for each land cover class identified in the 2001 base layer. MDA Federal used Classification and Regression Trees to assign land cover classes to 1984, 1992, and 2006 pixels exhibiting significant deviations from their 2001 expected spectral values. MDA Federal used these methods to develop the 1996 and 2005 land cover change datasets for the Mid-Atlantic coastal area funded by NOAA CCAP. Land use and land cover interpretations derived from Landsat satellite imagery are based on the sun's reflectance off the land surface, e.g., urban areas have different spectral reflectance characteristics than forests and herbaceous vegetation. For this reason, the data most accurately represent land cover (e.g., tree canopy) compared with land use or management (e.g., forests and pasture). Due to similarities in spectral reflectance characteristics, some land use and land cover classes are easily confused with each other. The spectral characteristics of low density residential areas, for example, may closely resemble the characteristics of forests in a neighborhood with mature trees or of cropland or pasture if large residential lots are composed mostly of lawns. Cropland and pasture may also have similar spectral qualities. Therefore, users should be cautioned against evaluating transitions between cropland and pasture based on the CBLCD. Users should be generally confident, however, that the overall spatial patterns of cropland and pasture in the Bay watershed are accurate because the USGS and NOAA used multi-season imagery to create the 2001 base layer and the data compare favorably with county-level cropland and pasture acreage estimates reported in the 2002 U.S. Census of Agriculture. The USGS is in the process of interpreting and publishing statistics on the extent, type, and patterns of land cover change from 1984-2006 in the Bay watershed, major tributaries, and counties. The USGS will also be publishing land change forecasts based on observed trends in the CBLCD. These additional interpretations, statistics, and datasets will be publicly released over the coming year following publication.",2006-01-01,2006,[u'U.S. Geological Survey'],9a476307-525a-463a-a9a5-2e4dc33222c7,,36.180919 -81.146651 44.752096 -81.146651 44.752096 -73.245998 36.180919 -73.245998 36.180919 -81.146651,2006,,9a476307-525a-463a-a9a5-2e4dc33222c7,36.180919 -81.146651 44.752096 -73.245998,"Chesapeake Bay Watershed Land Cover Data Series 2006: Chesapeake Bay, 2006",File,"[u'Chesapeake Bay, United States']",Pennsylvania Spatial Data Access (PASDA),9a476307-525a-463a-a9a5-2e4dc33222c7,Dataset,

The U.S. Census Bureau delineated census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where local or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. This is the first decennial census for which the entire United States is covered by census tracts. For the 1990 census, some counties had census tracts and others had block numbering areas (BNAs). In preparation for Census 2000, all BNAs were replaced by census tracts, which may or may not cover the same areas. Census tracts generally have between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. (Counties with fewer people have a single census tract.) When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over many decades so that statistical comparisons can be made from decennial census to decennial census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new developments, and so forth, may require occasional boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tracts are identified by a four-digit basic number and may have a two-digit numeric suffix; for example, 6059.02. The decimal point separating the four-digit basic tract number from the two-digit suffix is shown in the printed reports and on census maps. In computer-readable files, the decimal point is implied. Many census tracts do not have a suffix; in such cases, the suffix field is either left blank or is zero-filled. Leading zeros in a census tract number (for example, 002502) are shown only in computer-readable files. Census tract suffixes may range from .01 to .98. For the 1990 census, the .99 suffix was reserved for census tracts/block numbering areas (BNAs) that contained only crews-of-vessels population; for Census 2000, the crews-of-vessels population is part of the related census tract. Census tract numbers range from 1 to 9999 and are unique within a county or statistically equivalent entity. The U.S. Census Bureau reserves the basic census tract numbers 9400 to 9499 for census tracts delineated within or to encompass American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands that exist in multiple states or counties.

The NAIP acquires digital ortho imagery during the agricultural growing seasons in the continental U.S.. A primary goal of the NAIP program is to enable availability of ortho imagery within one year of acquisition. The NAIP provides two main products: 1 meter ground sample distance (GSD) ortho imagery rectified to a horizontal accuracy within +/- 5 meters of reference digital ortho quarter quads (DOQQ's) from the National Digital Ortho Program (NDOP) or from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP); 1 meter GSD ortho imagery rectified within +/- 6 meters to true ground. The tiling format of NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. The NAIP imagery is formatted to the UTM coordinate system using the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile. This file was generated by compressing NAIP imagery that cover the county extent. Two types of compression may be used for NAIP imagery: MrSID and JPEG 2000. Target value for the compression ratio is (15:1).,2009-08-31,2008,[u'USDA-FSA Aerial Photography Field Office'],d2f708b2-e522-4a51-8c53-67bb45bf9aa7,,38.808028 -75.818922 39.379133 -75.818922 39.379133 -75.24587 38.808028 -75.24587 38.808028 -75.818922,2008,[u'USDA FSA Aerial Photography Field Office'],d2f708b2-e522-4a51-8c53-67bb45bf9aa7,38.808028 -75.818922 39.379133 -75.24587,"National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) - County Mosaics: Delaware, 2009",File,"[u'Delaware, United States']",Pennsylvania Spatial Data Access (PASDA),d2f708b2-e522-4a51-8c53-67bb45bf9aa7,Dataset,

Fish Consumption use attainment - The risk posed to people by the consumption of aquatic organisms (ex. fish, shellfish, frogs, turtles, crayfish, etc.). Recreational use attainment - The risk associated with human recreation activities in or on a water body (i.e. exposure to bacteria and other disease causing organisms through water contact recreation like swimming or water skiing). Potable Water Supply use attainment - The risk posed to people by the ingestion of drinking water. Lakes that have appeared on an approved Category 5 Integrated Listing are the entries labeled as approved. Integrated Lists are submitted for approval every other year. Lakes entered subsequent to the latest approved Category 5 listing are labeled tentative. After appearing on an approved listing, the tentative entries move to approved. The Lake Integrated List is provided as two separate layers determined if the lake is attaining or not attaining its designated uses. DEP Lakes Integrated List layers are maintained by the PADEP Office of Water Management, Bureau of Water Supply & Wastewater Management, Water Quality Assessment and Standards Division.

The primary sources for this land cover layer were 2004 pan-sharpened 1m Ikonos satellite imagery, a normalized Digital Surface Model (nDSM) derived from 2006 LiDAR data, and LiDAR intensity data resulting from the 2006 acquisition. Other sources of data include the City's planimetric GIS database (building footprints and road casing polygons). The land cover classification was performed using automated object-based image analysis (OBIA) techniques in Definiens Developer/eCognition Server. No accuracy assessment was conducted, but the dataset was thoroughly reviewed at a scale of 1:2000. Over 370 corrections were made to the classification.",2006-12-30,2006,[u'University of Vermont Spatial Analysis Laboratory'],91da93cd-f378-4e11-9029-da674c6a4253,,38.69 -77.27 39.74 -77.27 39.74 -76.28 38.69 -76.28 38.69 -77.27,2006,,91da93cd-f378-4e11-9029-da674c6a4253,38.69 -77.27 39.74 -76.28,"Landcover: Baltimore County/metro area, Maryland, 2007",Raster Dataset,"[u'Baltimore County, Maryland, United States', u'Maryland, United States', u'Baltimore-Towson, Maryland, United States']",Pennsylvania Spatial Data Access (PASDA),91da93cd-f378-4e11-9029-da674c6a4253,Dataset,

Each land unit has only one land use designation interpreted by a 1, 2 or 3-digit code. Specificity of a land use description increases from the one to three digit code. Example: 1= Residential, 1.2 = Residential Medium Density, and 1.2.1 = Residential Rowhouse.Land use features are derived from Philadelphia Water Department tax parcel boundaries (2009 to current release date) and from other GIS datasets prepared by City departments including: planimetric features, transportation right-of-ways (ROW), parks and open space, and water. Land use boundaries are typically coincident with PWD tax parcel boundaries, where tax parcel boundaries are available to define units of land. In some cases multiple land activities on a single parcel and been individual represented as individual polygons of land use. This land use feature class is under revision through 2014. Updates will be made to correct attributes and features and to populate 3-digit codes based upon field verifications made by PCPC staff. Land use field surveys will be conducted for each of the 18 Planning District beginning in 2011 as part of the Philadelphia2035 Compressive Planning process.

These data were produced by MDA Federal Inc., under contract to the USGS and were derived from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper satellite imagery. Each of the four datasets consists of 16 land use and land cover classes (Anderson, et al., 1976). The datasets are temporally comparable and encompass the entire Chesapeake Bay watershed and most intersecting counties. The 2001 dataset represents the base layer for the Data Series and is composed of NOAA's 2001 Coastal Change Analysis Program (CCAP) dataset in the coastal and northern portion of the watershed coupled with USGS' 2001 National Land Cover Dataset in the western and southwestern portions of the watershed. MDA Federal's Cross Correlation Analysis (CCA) technique was used to produce updates (yr. 2006) and retrospective updates (yrs. 1984 and 1992) to the base layer. CCA identifies significant spectral changes between image pairs within the range of spectral values for each land cover class identified in the 2001 base layer. MDA Federal used Classification and Regression Trees to assign land cover classes to 1984, 1992, and 2006 pixels exhibiting significant deviations from their 2001 expected spectral values. MDA Federal used these methods to develop the 1996 and 2005 land cover change datasets for the Mid-Atlantic coastal area funded by NOAA CCAP. Land use and land cover interpretations derived from Landsat satellite imagery are based on the sun's reflectance off the land surface, e.g., urban areas have different spectral reflectance characteristics than forests and herbaceous vegetation. For this reason, the data most accurately represent land cover (e.g., tree canopy) compared with land use or management (e.g., forests and pasture). Due to similarities in spectral reflectance characteristics, some land use and land cover classes are easily confused with each other. The spectral characteristics of low density residential areas, for example, may closely resemble the characteristics of forests in a neighborhood with mature trees or of cropland or pasture if large residential lots are composed mostly of lawns. Cropland and pasture may also have similar spectral qualities. Therefore, users should be cautioned against evaluating transitions between cropland and pasture based on the CBLCD. Users should be generally confident, however, that the overall spatial patterns of cropland and pasture in the Bay watershed are accurate because the USGS and NOAA used multi-season imagery to create the 2001 base layer and the data compare favorably with county-level cropland and pasture acreage estimates reported in the 2002 U.S. Census of Agriculture. The USGS is in the process of interpreting and publishing statistics on the extent, type, and patterns of land cover change from 1984-2006 in the Bay watershed, major tributaries, and counties. The USGS will also be publishing land change forecasts based on observed trends in the CBLCD. These additional interpretations, statistics, and datasets will be publicly released over the coming year following publication.",2001-01-01,2001,[u'U.S. Geological Survey'],e16e7507-4cd4-40e3-ae1d-1a4e4c9d0ab8,,36.180919 -81.146651 44.752096 -81.146651 44.752096 -73.245998 36.180919 -73.245998 36.180919 -81.146651,2001,,e16e7507-4cd4-40e3-ae1d-1a4e4c9d0ab8,36.180919 -81.146651 44.752096 -73.245998,"Chesapeake Bay Watershed Land Cover Data Series 2001: Chesapeake Bay, 2001",File,"[u'Chesapeake Bay, United States']",Pennsylvania Spatial Data Access (PASDA),e16e7507-4cd4-40e3-ae1d-1a4e4c9d0ab8,Dataset,

The classification system was adopted as a national classification standard in 1996 by the Federal Geographic Data Committee. This dataset is one of a series available in 7.5 minute by 7.5 minute blocks containing ground planimetric coordinates of wetlands point, line, and polygon features and wetlands attributes. When completed, the series will provide coverage for all of the contiguous United States, Hawaii, Alaska, and U.S. protectorates in the Pacific and Caribbean. Coverage includes both digital data and hardcopy maps. The NWI maps do not show all wetlands since the maps are derived from aerial photointerpretation with varying limitations due to scale, photo quality, inventory techniques, and other factors. Consequently, the maps tend to show wetlands that are readily photointerpreted given consideration of photo and map scale. In general, the older NWI maps prepared from 1970s-era black and white photography (1:80,000 scale) tend to be very conservative, with many forested and drier-end emergent wetlands (e.g., wet meadows) not mapped. Maps derived from color infrared photography tend to yield more accurate results except when this photography was captured during a dry year, making wetland identification equally difficult. Proper use of NWI maps therefore requires knowledge of the inherent limitations of this mapping. It is suggested that users also consult other information to aid in wetland detection, such as U.S. Department of Agriculture soil survey reports and other wetland maps that may have been produced by state and local governments, and not rely solely on NWI maps.

These data were produced by MDA Federal Inc., under contract to the USGS and were derived from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper satellite imagery. Each of the four datasets consists of 16 land use and land cover classes (Anderson, et al., 1976). The datasets are temporally comparable and encompass the entire Chesapeake Bay watershed and most intersecting counties. The 2001 dataset represents the base layer for the Data Series and is composed of NOAA's 2001 Coastal Change Analysis Program (CCAP) dataset in the coastal and northern portion of the watershed coupled with USGS' 2001 National Land Cover Dataset in the western and southwestern portions of the watershed. MDA Federal's Cross Correlation Analysis (CCA) technique was used to produce updates (yr. 2006) and retrospective updates (yrs. 1984 and 1992) to the base layer. CCA identifies significant spectral changes between image pairs within the range of spectral values for each land cover class identified in the 2001 base layer. MDA Federal used Classification and Regression Trees to assign land cover classes to 1984, 1992, and 2006 pixels exhibiting significant deviations from their 2001 expected spectral values. MDA Federal used these methods to develop the 1996 and 2005 land cover change datasets for the Mid-Atlantic coastal area funded by NOAA CCAP. Land use and land cover interpretations derived from Landsat satellite imagery are based on the sun's reflectance off the land surface, e.g., urban areas have different spectral reflectance characteristics than forests and herbaceous vegetation. For this reason, the data most accurately represent land cover (e.g., tree canopy) compared with land use or management (e.g., forests and pasture). Due to similarities in spectral reflectance characteristics, some land use and land cover classes are easily confused with each other. The spectral characteristics of low density residential areas, for example, may closely resemble the characteristics of forests in a neighborhood with mature trees or of cropland or pasture if large residential lots are composed mostly of lawns. Cropland and pasture may also have similar spectral qualities. Therefore, users should be cautioned against evaluating transitions between cropland and pasture based on the CBLCD. Users should be generally confident, however, that the overall spatial patterns of cropland and pasture in the Bay watershed are accurate because the USGS and NOAA used multi-season imagery to create the 2001 base layer and the data compare favorably with county-level cropland and pasture acreage estimates reported in the 2002 U.S. Census of Agriculture. The USGS is in the process of interpreting and publishing statistics on the extent, type, and patterns of land cover change from 1984-2006 in the Bay watershed, major tributaries, and counties. The USGS will also be publishing land change forecasts based on observed trends in the CBLCD.

The classification system was adopted as a national classification standard in 1996 by the Federal Geographic Data Committee. This dataset is one of a series available in 7.5 minute by 7.5 minute blocks containing ground planimetric coordinates of wetlands point, line, and polygon features and wetlands attributes. When completed, the series will provide coverage for all of the contiguous United States, Hawaii, Alaska, and U.S. protectorates in the Pacific and Caribbean. Coverage includes both digital data and hardcopy maps. The NWI maps do not show all wetlands since the maps are derived from aerial photointerpretation with varying limitations due to scale, photo quality, inventory techniques, and other factors. Consequently, the maps tend to show wetlands that are readily photointerpreted given consideration of photo and map scale. In general, the older NWI maps prepared from 1970s-era black and white photography (1:80,000 scale) tend to be very conservative, with many forested and drier-end emergent wetlands (e.g., wet meadows) not mapped. Maps derived from color infrared photography tend to yield more accurate results except when this photography was captured during a dry year, making wetland identification equally difficult. Proper use of NWI maps therefore requires knowledge of the inherent limitations of this mapping. It is suggested that users also consult other information to aid in wetland detection, such as U.S. Department of Agriculture soil survey reports and other wetland maps that may have been produced by state and local governments, and not rely solely on NWI maps.

Total personal income is all the income that is received by, or on behalf of, the residents of a particular area. It is calculated as the sum of wage and salary disbursements, other labor income, proprietors' income with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments, rental income of persons with capital consumption adjustment, personal dividend income, personal interest income, and transfer payments to persons, minus personal contributions for social insurance. Per capita personal income is calculated as the total personal income of the residents of a county divided by the resident population of the county. The Census Bureau's annual midyear population estimates were used in the computation. The average annual number of full-time and part-time jobs includes all jobs for which wages and salaries are paid, except jury and witness service and paid employment of prisoners. The jobs are counted at equal weight, and employees, sole proprietors, and active partners are all included. Unpaid family workers and volunteers are not included. Average wage per job is the total wage and salary disbursements divided by the number of wage and salary jobs in the county. Wage and salary disbursements consist of the monetary remuneration of employees, including the compensation of corporate officers; commissions, tips, and bonuses; and receipts in kind, or pay-in-kind, such as the meals furnished to the employees of restaurants. It reflects the amount of payments disbursed, but not necessarily earned during the year. Per capita number of jobs is calculated as the average annual number of full-time and part-time jobs in a county divided by the resident population of the county.

The tiling format of NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. The NAIP imagery is formatted to the UTM coordinate system using the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile. This file was generated by compressing NAIP imagery that cover the county extent. Two types of compression may be used for NAIP imagery: MrSID and JPEG 2000.

The 2005 land cover for Pennsylvania was created through a mix of interpretation of remotely sensed data and use of ancillary data sources. The date actually is a mid-point as the remotely sensed and ancillary data are representative of the time period 2003-2007. The coding is based on the Anderson Land Use/Land Cover system, where the more descriptive detail in the category is reflected by a higher code value. Using an inside buffer of 18 meters on the Landscape Blocks a new shapefile was created in order to create a 30 meter area between the blocks to represent roads. Natural vegetation cover (Water, Coniferous Forest, Mixed Forest, Deciduous Forest, Woody Wetland, and Emergent Wetland) from the 2005 Land Cover was reclassified and then the road buffered landscape blocks were combined with the raster to assign a value of N0N to areas in the natural vegetation land cover that overlap with the road buffers. Acreage of the contiguous natural vegetation was calculated and the data was reclassified based on conservation value as follows: Acreage Conservation Value 0-100 0 100-250 1 250-500 2 500-1000 3 1000-2500 4 2500-5000 5 5000-7500 6 7500-15000 7 15000-25000 8 25000-40000 9 > 40000 10 Conservation values were determined by experts gathered by Natural Lands Trust through SmartConservation.

Seven land cover classes were mapped: (1) tree canopy, (2) grass/shrub, (3) bare earth, (4) water, (5) buildings, (6) roads, and (7) other paved surfaces. The minimum mapping unit for the delineation of features was set at six square meters. The primary sources used to derive this land cover layer were 2008 LiDAR data and 2010 - 2011 NAIP imagery. LiDAR coverage was complete for the Pennsylvaia portion of the AOI, however, LiDAR was unavailable for large portions of the New York portion. Where LiDAR was not available, imagery was the primary data source. Ancillary data sources included GIS data (eg. such as hydrology, breakline and buildings) provided by the counties of Lackawana, Monroe, Pike and Wayne, PA, as well as the New York State GIS Clearinghouse. Some of these vector datasets were edited by the UVM Spatial Analysis lab through manual interpretation. Other datasets, such as bare soil, were created by the UVM Spatial Anyslsis Lab in order to assist in landcover creation.

OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets. Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process.

OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets. Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process. A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing. No accuracy assessment was conducted, but the dataset was subject to a thorough manual quality control. More than 26497 corrections were made to the classification.",2011-08-05,2009,[u'University of Vermont Spatial Analysis Laboratory'],43ff622d-4525-4e5e-bf2a-0ad1afa62297,,38.67579 -75.28925 39.286931 -75.28925 39.286931 -74.836712 38.67579 -74.836712 38.67579 -75.28925,2009,,43ff622d-4525-4e5e-bf2a-0ad1afa62297,38.67579 -75.28925 39.286931 -74.836712,"Landcover - Prince Georges County, Maryland: Maryland, 2011",File,"[u'Maryland, United States']",Pennsylvania Spatial Data Access (PASDA),43ff622d-4525-4e5e-bf2a-0ad1afa62297,Dataset,

The then-available physiographic provinces map was compiled by the Survey at 1:500,000 scale and published at 1:2,000,000 scale in 1989. A new physiographic provinces map was recompiled on county 1:50,000-scale topographic maps having 20-foot contour intervals. Boundaries based primarily on geology were positioned using published geological maps. Most boundaries were positioned by topographic interpretation. The use of a 20-foot contour interval (a 200-foot interval was used in 1989) resulted in the repositioning of some boundaries. New scale-enhanced understanding of topographic/geologic patterns in the Appalachian Plateaus province resulted in the creation of three new sections and the revision of other section boundaries. The new compilation was reduced 50 percent and transferred to 1:100,000-scale mylar base maps. The province and section boundaries and the late Wisconsinan glacial border were digitized from the mylars, edgematched, assembled into a single dataset, and attributed with physiographic province and section names using UNIX-based Arc/Info. The late Wisconsinan glacial border, which coincides with province and section boundaries in some places, was copied to a separate dataset and removed from the dataset containing the province and section boundaries. There are two datasets for the late Wisconsinan glacial border and the physiographic province and section boundaries. The original datasets are accurate at 1:100,000 scale. The other datasets have been generalized to 1:500,000-scale accuracy for more regional work.

The user must have a firm understanding of how the datasets were compiled and the resulting limitations of these data. The National Land Cover Dataset was compiled from Landsat satellite TM imagery (circa 1992) with a spatial resolution of 30 meters and supplemented by various ancillary data (where available). The analysis and interpretation of the satellite imagery was conducted using very large, sometimes multi-state image mosaics (i.e. up to 18 Landsat scenes). Using a relatively small number of aerial photographs for 'ground truth', the thematic interpretations were necessarily conducted from a spatially-broad perspective. Furthermore, the accuracy assessments (see below) correspond to 'federal regions' which are groupings of contiguous states. Thus, the reliability of the data is greatest at the state or multi-state level. The statistical accuracy of the data is known only for the region. Important Caution Advisory With this in mind, users are cautioned to carefully scrutinize the data to see if they are of sufficient reliability before attempting to use the dataset for larger-scale or local analyses. This evaluation must be made remembering that the NLCD represents conditions in the early 1990s. The Pennsylvania portion of the NLCD was created as part of land cover mapping activities for Federal Region III that includes the States of Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. The NLCD classification contains 21 different land cover categories with a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The NLCD was produced as a cooperative effort between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) to produce a consistent, land cover data layer for the conterminous U.S. using early 1990s Landsat thematic mapper (TM) data purchased by the Multi-resolution Land Characterization (MRLC) Consortium.

This layer displays the location of features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management.

The analysis was done by first overlaying the stream shapefile on the orthophotos. Next a 50 ft. buffer shapefile was derived from the streamlines and added. Using the newly created buffer shapefile as a guide, visual analysis was done for entire shapefile. The canopy coverage percentage was interpeted by Heritage Conservancy and buffer shapefile was used to define the 50 ft. distance requirement. At a scale of 1:2,000, the streamlines were attributed with one of three riparian values (full, half, none). - Full Value: both banks of the stream contain 50% or greater canopy coverage for 50 ft from the stream. - Half Value: only one bank of the stream contains 50% or greater canopy coverage. - None Value: neither stream bank contains 50% or greater canopy coverage. The threshold for determining whether or not a shoreline segment or a stream centerline segment should be used for the analysis was if the waterway was wider than 100 ft for a linear distance of approximately 400 ft. If a waterway was wider than 100 ft. for a linear distance of approximately 400 ft., shorelines would be used rather than stream centerlines. Having the threshold include a 400 ft linear distance requirement made many ponds be represented by a centerline rather than a shoreline. In cases were the original data contained two shorelines to represent a stream that was not greater than 100 ft wide, a new centerline was created by Heritage Conservancy by using the orthophotos and the shorelines as guides. Ponds that were delineated to represent headwaters were not included in this analysis. Analysis and editing would begin at the tributary originating from the pond, but the pond itself would not be given a riparian value. Edits to the shape of the streamline were done when they were visually obvious. The point of this analysis was not to delineate new stream lines, but rather to give existing streamlines riparian buffer attributes. The large majority of the segments are identical to the original Berks County Planning Commission streamlines. Stream and shorelines were cut into segments based on the riparian attribute value. Ten sites were chosen for on-site verification and they were visited in July 2007. Source Data: Streamlines - The streamlines were obtained from the Berks County Planning Commission in draft form for the analysis. 2004 Orthophotos - The orthophotos were provided by the Berks County Planning Commission. The following is the metadata for the orthophotos: NAn orthoimage is remotely sensed image data in which displacement of features in the image caused by terrain relief and sensor orientation have been mathematically removed. Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. For this dataset, the natural color orthoimages were produced at 1-foot pixel resolution. Each orthoimage provides imagery for a 10,000 by 10,000 feet block on the ground. The projected coordinate system is Pennsylvania State Plane with a NAD83 datum. There is no image overlap been adjacent files. The ortho image filenames were derived from the northwest corner of each ortho tile using the first four digits of the northing and easting coordinates referenced to the Pennsylvania State Plane coordinate system, followed by the State designator NPAN, and the State Plane zone designator NSN. This dataset consists of 10000' x 10000' uncompressed natural color (24-bit) GeoTIFF files with ESRI world files and MrSid compression format at a pixel resolution of 1'. Digital orthophotography combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. Digital orthophotography is a process which converts aerial photography from an original photo negative to a digital product that has been positionally corrected for camera lens distortion, vertical displacement and variations in aircraft altitude and orientation. The imagery was captured at a negative scale of 1:19200 for the purpose of producing orthophotos.N",2007-09-02,2007,[u'Heritage Conservancy'],30992666-255d-4583-973f-d7dc39f6d1c3,,40.13732 -76.420229 40.672318 -76.420229 40.672318 -75.528532 40.13732 -75.528532 40.13732 -76.420229,2007,,30992666-255d-4583-973f-d7dc39f6d1c3,40.13732 -76.420229 40.672318 -75.528532,"Riparian Streams - Berks County: Pennsylvania, 2007",File,"[u'Pennsylvania, United States']",Pennsylvania Spatial Data Access (PASDA),30992666-255d-4583-973f-d7dc39f6d1c3,Dataset,

In the 150 years subsequent to this, an unknown number of oil and gas wells have been drilled in the state. A current estimate by the Independent Petroleum Association of America places that number at approximately 325,000. Of those 325,000 wells, over 200,000 are still unaccounted for. As these wells are found and verified, they are cataloged in the Department of Environmental Protections (DEP) Abandoned and Orphan Well database to facilitate plugging. There are currently over 8,200 wells listed in this database (2013). With so many unknown oil and gas wells scattered across Pennsylvania and the environmental threats that they pose, identification remains a vital component of DEPs Oil and Gas Program. Currently, the DEP, Office of Active and Abandoned Mine Operations is involved in many projects dealing with historic and active mine map restoration and geo-referencing. These maps, which vary in age, not only contain information on historic mine locations, but also oil and gas locations. Through collaboration between the Bureau of Mining Programs and the Bureau of Oil and Gas Planning and Program Management, potential oil and gas well locations were assembled using three mine map collections. These collections include the WPA mine map collection, KSheets collection, and the HSheets collection. From these sources, over 30,000 potential historic oil and gas well locations were derived. The Bureau of Oil and Gas Planning and Program Management is constantly looking for historic sources to help locate oil and gas wells in the state that remain unaccounted for. This particular dataset was created using georeferenced mine maps of various/unknown accuracy and various/unknown coordinate systems to various base maps, including but not limited to USGS topographic maps and PAMAP aerial photography. The locations were then digitized using the georeferenced mine maps.

The date actually is a mid-point as the remotely sensed and ancillary data are representative of the time period 2003-2007. The coding is based on the Anderson Land Use/Land Cover system, where the more descriptive detail in the category is reflected by a higher code value. Using an inside buffer of 18 meters on the Landscape Blocks a new shapefile was created in order to create a 30 meter area between the blocks to represent roads. Natural vegetation cover (Water, Coniferous Forest, Mixed Forest, Deciduous Forest, Woody Wetland, and Emergent Wetland) from the 2005 Land Cover was reclassified and then the road buffered landscape blocks were combined with the raster to assign a value of N0N to areas in the natural vegetation land cover that overlap with the road buffers.

Wage and salary disbursements consist of the monetary remuneration of employees, including the compensation of corporate officers; commissions, tips, and bonuses; and receipts in kind, or pay-in-kind, such as the meals furnished to the employees of restaurants. It reflects the amount of payments disbursed, but not necessarily earned during the year. Per capita number of jobs is calculated as the average annual number of full-time and part-time jobs in a county divided by the resident population of the county.

The imagery was collected between April 24, 2002 and September 12, 2002. The approximate scale is 1:100,000 with a ground resolution of 30 meters by 30 meters. The CDL emphasis is on agricultural land cover. The area of coverage is the entire State of Delaware This land cover dataset is part of a one-time series in which ten Mid-Atlantic States were categorized based on the extensive field observations collected during the 2002 annual NASS June Agricultural Survey. No farmer reported data is included or derivable from the Cropland Data Layer. The area of coverage for the 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL includes the entire states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and West Virginia. The funding for this project was shared between the USDA-NASS and Towson State University. The 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL is currently a special one-time project. However, the possibility does exist to establish an annual cropland data layer for any state that shows significant interest and can offer an in-state cooperative agreement with another federal, state, local, or university agency or group.

The soil maps for STATSGO are compiled by generalizing more detailed soil survey maps.

Soils of like areas are studied, and the probable classification and extent of the soils are determined. Map unit composition for a STATSGO map is determined by transecting or sampling areas on the more detailed maps and expanding the data statistically to characterize the whole map unit. This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data.

The 2005 land cover for Pennsylvania was created through a mix of interpretation of remotely sensed data and use of ancillary data sources. The date actually is a mid-point as the remotely sensed and ancillary data are representative of the time period 2003-2007. The coding is based on the Anderson Land Use/Land Cover system, where the more descriptive detail in the category is reflected by a higher code value. Using an inside buffer of 18 meters on the Landscape Blocks a new shapefile was created in order to create a 30 meter area between the blocks to represent roads. The road buffered landscape blocks were combined with the Forest cover (Coniferous Forest, Mixed Forest, Deciduous Forest, and Woody Wetland) raster to assign a value of N0N to areas in the natural vegetation land cover that overlap with the road buffers. Using an inside buffer of 300 feet on the Forest Cover (Coniferous Forest, Mixed Forest, Deciduous Forest, and Woody Wetland) from the 2005 land cover, the interior forest raster was created. Acreage of the contiguous interior forest was calculated and the data was reclassified based on conservation value as follows: Acreage Conservation Value 0-20 0 20-100 1 100-250 2 250-500 3 500-1000 4 1000-2500 5 2500-5000 6 5000-10000 7 10000-15000 8 15000-20000 9 >20000 10 No data 0 Conservation values were determined by experts gathered by Natural Lands Trust through SmartConservation. This data set is one of several that have been combined to create an overall terrestrial resources conservation value raster for the High Allegheny Plateau Ecoregion.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census. For example, Census 2000 tabulation blocks 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within Census 2000 tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract. Census 2000 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to delineate BGs or where the Census Bureau could not identify any local PSAP participant. A BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian areas. BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs coded 0 were intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas. For Census 2000, rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and BG of 0 to these offshore, water-only areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas.

The reuse of industrial land is an important component of a sound land use policy that will help prevent the needless development of prime farmland, open-space areas and natural areas and reduce public costs for installing new water, sewer, and highway infrastructure. CERCLA Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, also known as the Superfund This act was passed by Congress as a federal law in December of 1980, creating a tax on chemical and petroleum industries to: Identify and respond to sites from which releases of hazardous substances into the environment have occurred or could potentially occur Ensure they are cleaned up by responsible parties or through government funding Evaluate damages to natural resources HSCA Hazardous Sites Cleanup Act [This Act] provides the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) with the funding and the authority to conduct cleanup actions at sites where hazardous substances have been released. HSCA also provides DEP with enforcement authorities to force the persons who are responsible for releases of hazardous substances to conduct cleanup actions or to repay public funds spent on a DEP funded cleanup action. HSCA funds are also used to pay the state share of costs of cleanup actions at Pennsylvania sites in the Federal Superfund program. Under the provisions of HSCA, most HSCA sites involve bankrupt facility owners, abandoned facilities, and inappropriate disposal of hazardous substances. As a general rule, HSCA sites do not include active facilities with financially viable owners.

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 52 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 104 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 84 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2005). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

The 2005 land cover for Pennsylvania was created through a mix of interpretation of remotely sensed data and use of ancillary data sources. The date actually is a mid-point as the remotely sensed and ancillary data are representative of the time period 2003-2007. The coding is based on the Anderson Land Use/Land Cover system, where the more descriptive detail in the category is reflected by a higher code value. Using an inside buffer of 18 meters on the Landscape Blocks a new shapefile was created in order to create a 30 meter area between the blocks to represent roads. Grasslands vegetation cover (Pasture/Grass) from the 2005 land cover was reclassified and then the road buffered landscape blocks were combined with the raster to assign a value of N0N to areas in the Grasslands land cover that overlap with the road buffers. Acreage of the grasslands vegetation was calculated and the data was reclassified based on conservation value as follows: Acreage Conservation Value 0-25 0 25-100 1 100-150 3 150-200 4 200-600 5 > 600 6 Conservation values were determined by experts gathered by Natural Lands Trust through SmartConservation.

Important in preserving heritage and traditional values, cultural lands often define sense of place. The objective of the cultural assessment is to identify lands that provide cultural assets and further inform preservation efforts with spatial information about cultural lands. This spatial information about cultural resources can provide an added value to land preservation because cultural lands provide a historic perspective for interpreting land and people's relationship with it. Additionally, the value of an historic or cultural site is often intrinsically tied to the landscape context in which it is located.

The 2005 land cover for Pennsylvania was created through a mix of interpretation of remotely sensed data and use of ancillary data sources. The date actually is a mid-point as the remotely sensed and ancillary data are representative of the time period 2003-2007. The coding is based on the Anderson Land Use/Land Cover system, where the more descriptive detail in the category is reflected by a higher code value. Using an inside buffer of 18 meters on the Landscape Blocks a new shapefile was created in order to create a 30 meter area between the blocks to represent roads. The road buffered landscape blocks were combined with the Forest cover (Coniferous Forest, Mixed Forest, Deciduous Forest, and Woody Wetland) raster to assign a value of N0N to areas in the natural vegetation land cover that overlap with the road buffers. Using an inside buffer of 300 feet on the Forest cover (Coniferous Forest, Mixed Forest, Deciduous Forest, and Woody Wetland) from the 2005 land cover, the interior forest raster was created. Acreage of the contiguous interior forest was calculated and the data was reclassified based on conservation value as follows: Acreage Conservation Value 0-20 0 20-100 1 100-250 2 250-500 3 500-1000 4 1000-2500 5 2500-5000 6 5000-10000 7 10000-15000 8 15000-20000 9 >20000 10 No data 0 Conservation values were determined by experts gathered by Natural Lands Trust through SmartConservation.

Seven land cover classes were mapped: (1) tree canopy, (2) grass/shrub, (3) bare earth, (4) water, (5) buildings, (6) roads, and (7) other paved surfaces. The minimum mapping unit for the delineation of features was set at six square meters. The primary sources used to derive this land cover layer were 2008 LiDAR data and 2010 - 2011 NAIP imagery. LiDAR coverage was complete for the Pennsylvaia portion of the AOI, however, LiDAR was unavailable for large portions of the New York portion. Where LiDAR was not available, imagery was the primary data source. Ancillary data sources included GIS data (eg. such as hydrology, breakline and buildings) provided by the counties of Lackawana, Monroe, Pike and Wayne, PA, as well as the New York State GIS Clearinghouse. Some of these vector datasets were edited by the UVM Spatial Analysis lab through manual interpretation. Other datasets, such as bare soil, were created by the UVM Spatial Anyslsis Lab in order to assist in landcover creation. This land cover dataset is considered current for Pennsylvania portion of the study area as of summer 2010. The dataset is current as of summer 2011 for the New York counties of Chenango, Delaware, Orange and Sullivan. Broome County, NY, is considered current as of summer 2010. Ulster County, NY, employed data from both summer 2010 and summer 2011, therefore currentness varies throughout the county. Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) were employed to extract land cover information using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets. OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets. Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process. A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing.

The then-available physiographic provinces map was compiled by the Survey at 1:500,000 scale and published at 1:2,000,000 scale in 1989. A new physiographic provinces map was recompiled on county 1:50,000-scale topographic maps having 20-foot contour intervals. Boundaries based primarily on geology were positioned using published geological maps. Most boundaries were positioned by topographic interpretation. The use of a 20-foot contour interval (a 200-foot interval was used in 1989) resulted in the repositioning of some boundaries. New scale-enhanced understanding of topographic/geologic patterns in the Appalachian Plateaus province resulted in the creation of three new sections and the revision of other section boundaries. The new compilation was reduced 50 percent and transferred to 1:100,000-scale mylar base maps. The province and section boundaries and the late Wisconsinan glacial border were digitized from the mylars, edgematched, assembled into a single dataset, and attributed with physiographic province and section names using UNIX-based Arc/Info. The late Wisconsinan glacial border, which coincides with province and section boundaries in some places, was copied to a separate dataset and removed from the dataset containing the province and section boundaries. There are two datasets for the late Wisconsinan glacial border and the physiographic province and section boundaries. The original datasets are accurate at 1:100,000 scale. The other datasets have been generalized to 1:500,000-scale accuracy for more regional work.

The user must have a firm understanding of how the datasets were compiled and the resulting limitations of these data. The National Land Cover Dataset was compiled from Landsat satellite TM imagery (circa 1992) with a spatial resolution of 30 meters and supplemented by various ancillary data (where available). The analysis and interpretation of the satellite imagery was conducted using very large, sometimes multi-state image mosaics (i.e. up to 18 Landsat scenes). Using a relatively small number of aerial photographs for 'ground truth', the thematic interpretations were necessarily conducted from a spatially-broad perspective. Furthermore, the accuracy assessments (see below) correspond to 'federal regions' which are groupings of contiguous states. Thus, the reliability of the data is greatest at the state or multi-state level. The statistical accuracy of the data is known only for the region. Important Caution Advisory With this in mind, users are cautioned to carefully scrutinize the data to see if they are of sufficient reliability before attempting to use the dataset for larger-scale or local analyses. This evaluation must be made remembering that the NLCD represents conditions in the early 1990s. The Pennsylvania portion of the NLCD was created as part of land cover mapping activities for Federal Region III that includes the States of Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. The NLCD classification contains 21 different land cover categories with a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The NLCD was produced as a cooperative effort between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) to produce a consistent, land cover data layer for the conterminous U.S. using early 1990s Landsat thematic mapper (TM) data purchased by the Multi-resolution Land Characterization (MRLC) Consortium.

The tiling format of NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. The NAIP imagery is formatted to the UTM coordinate system using the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile. This file was generated by compressing NAIP imagery that cover the county extent. Two types of compression may be used for NAIP imagery: MrSID and JPEG 2000.

Then click the NView Regions & BlocksN link, select a block, click its NBlock MapN tab and choose whether to print an air photo or a topo map. This site can be used to help you find the particular 2nd PBBA block where you live or where you make any of your breeding bird observations. You can zoom directly to a point by entering a latitude and longitude. Be sure to use decimal degree format and always include a minus (-) sign before the longitude. Or, you can type in a street address. Be sure to enter both the address and the associated zip code. When you click NRefresh Map,N the point or address you entered will be shown as a yellow circle on the map within the Atlas block, which is outlined with green lines and identified with a small number, such as 62B43. The ability to locate 2nd PBBA blocks for a specific lat/long is very helpful, for example, if you have been hiking or boating through an area covering several Atlas blocks, all the while collecting waypoints to go along with breeding bird sightings that you make.

The classification system was adopted as a national classification standard in 1996 by the Federal Geographic Data Committee. This dataset is one of a series available in 7.5 minute by 7.5 minute blocks containing ground planimetric coordinates of wetlands point, line, and polygon features and wetlands attributes. When completed, the series will provide coverage for all of the contiguous United States, Hawaii, Alaska, and U.S. protectorates in the Pacific and Caribbean. Coverage includes both digital data and hardcopy maps. The NWI maps do not show all wetlands since the maps are derived from aerial photointerpretation with varying limitations due to scale, photo quality, inventory techniques, and other factors. Consequently, the maps tend to show wetlands that are readily photointerpreted given consideration of photo and map scale. In general, the older NWI maps prepared from 1970s-era black and white photography (1:80,000 scale) tend to be very conservative, with many forested and drier-end emergent wetlands (e.g., wet meadows) not mapped. Maps derived from color infrared photography tend to yield more accurate results except when this photography was captured during a dry year, making wetland identification equally difficult. Proper use of NWI maps therefore requires knowledge of the inherent limitations of this mapping. It is suggested that users also consult other information to aid in wetland detection, such as U.S. Department of Agriculture soil survey reports and other wetland maps that may have been produced by state and local governments, and not rely solely on NWI maps.

Paved Roads are roads that are surfaced with concrete or asphalt. Roads that have been tarred and chipped are also considered paved. Roads surfaced with gravel or packed dirt are considered Unpaved. An Alleyway is a road, usually narrower than surrounding roads that runs between, but parallel to, two paved roads. An Alley can be either paved or unpaved. Generally, Outbuildings will be adjacent to Alleyways. Road pavement edges that are underneath bridges or overpasses are coded as Hidden. Bridges and Overpasses are delineated along the outside edge of the structure. Portions of bridges that are under other bridges or other objects are coded as Hidden Bridge. Tunnels are shown as lines connecting the apparent width of the tunnel through the earth. Stairways are major pedestrian thoroughfares, either paved or wooden, connecting two (2) roads and typically found on steep hills. Airfield Runways are the edges of Runways, Taxiways and other airfield pavement areas. Driveways that are greater than 300' in length will be digitized and coded as either Paved Road or Unpaved Road. Paved Road edges show the width of the paved area. If the paved road has a paved shoulder, the paved shoulder is shown as part of the paved road. The placement of an unpaved road is subject to interpretation by the photogrammetrist since the road edge may be indefinite due to the imprecise nature of an unpaved surface. Driveways that are over 300' in length are digitized. For a driveway that terminates at a building, it shall be drawn to the building. Driveways will also have a centerline for its entire length. Parking lots are not digitized. The entrance to a parking lot for shopping areas shall be shown. Driving areas around and through parking lots serving shopping areas and other businesses are considered part of the parking lot. If the driving area through a parking lot connects to two (2) or more exterior roads, the main thoroughfare through the parking lot shall be shown as a road. The driving area through an apartment complex or condominium complex shall be digitized as a road. The road is needed in these areas to show access to the individual dwelling places.

Then click the NView Regions & BlocksN link, select a block, click its NBlock MapN tab and choose whether to print an air photo or a topo map. This site can be used to help you find the particular 2nd PBBA block where you live or where you make any of your breeding bird observations. You can zoom directly to a point by entering a latitude and longitude. Be sure to use decimal degree format and always include a minus (-) sign before the longitude. Or, you can type in a street address. Be sure to enter both the address and the associated zip code. When you click NRefresh Map,N the point or address you entered will be shown as a yellow circle on the map within the Atlas block, which is outlined with green lines and identified with a small number, such as 62B43. The ability to locate 2nd PBBA blocks for a specific lat/long is very helpful, for example, if you have been hiking or boating through an area covering several Atlas blocks, all the while collecting waypoints to go along with breeding bird sightings that you make.

The U.S. Census Bureau delineated census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where local or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. Census tracts generally have between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. Counties with fewer people have a single census tract.) When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over many decades so that statistical comparisons can be made from decennial census to decennial census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new developments, and so forth, may require occasional boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or combined as a result of substantial population decline.Census tracts are identified by a four-digit basic number and may have a two-digit numeric suffix; or example, 6059.02. The decimal point separating the four-digit basic tract number from the two-digit suffix is shown in the printed reports and on census maps. In computer-readable files, the decimal point is implied. Many census tracts do not have a suffix; in such cases, the suffix field is either left blank or is zero-filled. Leading zeros in a census tract number (for example, 002502) are shown only in computer-readable files. Census tract suffixes may range from .01 to .98. For the 1990 census, the .99 suffix was reserved for census tracts/block numbering areas (BNAs) that contained only crews-of-vessels population; for Census 2000, the crews-of-vessels population is part of the related census tract.Census tract numbers range from 1 to 9999 and are unique within a county or statistically equivalent entity. The U.S. Census Bureau reserves the basic census tract numbers 9400 to 9499 for census tracts delineated within or to encompass American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands that exist in multiple states or counties. The number 0000 in computer-readable files identifies a census tract delineated to provide complete coverage of water area in territorial seas and the Great Lakes.

One of the primary goals of the project is to generate a current, consistent, seamless, and accurate National Land cover Database (NLCD) circa 2001 for the United States at medium spatial resolution. This landcover map and all documents pertaining to it are considered NprovisionalN until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted. For a detailed definition and discussion on MRLC and the NLCD 2001 products, refer to Homer et al. (2004) and http://www.mrlc.gov/mrlc2k.asp. The NLCD 2001 is created by partitioning the U.S. into mapping zones. A total of 66 mapping zones were delineated within the conterminous U.S. based on ecoregion and geographical characteristics, edge matching features and the size requirement of Landsat mosaics.

The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). One of the primary goals of the project is to generate a current, consistent, seamless, and accurate National Land cover Database (NLCD) circa 2001 for the United States at medium spatial resolution. This landcover map and all documents pertaining to it are considered NprovisionalN until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted. For a detailed definition and discussion on MRLC and the NLCD 2001 products, refer to Homer et al. (2004) and http://www.mrlc.gov/mrlc2k.asp. The NLCD 2001 is created by partitioning the U.S. into mapping zones. A total of 66 mapping zones were delineated within the conterminous U.S. based on ecoregion and geographical characteristics, edge matching features and the size requirement of Landsat mosaics. Mapping zone 60 encompasses whole or portions of several states, including the states of New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Questions about the NLCD mapping zone 60 can be directed to the NLCD 2001 land cover mapping team at the National Center, EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.",2003-09-01,1999-2001,[u'U.S. Geological Survey'],a0117cd9-b4db-41cf-bd01-b407594ce210,,35.78466 -78.124012 40.81651 -78.124012 40.81651 -73.849718 35.78466 -73.849718 35.78466 -78.124012,1999,[u'U.S. Geological Survey'],a0117cd9-b4db-41cf-bd01-b407594ce210,35.78466 -78.124012 40.81651 -73.849718,"National Land Cover Database 2001 - Land Cover Layer: Pennsylvania and Northeast, 2003",File,"[u'Pennsylvania, United States']",Pennsylvania Spatial Data Access (PASDA),a0117cd9-b4db-41cf-bd01-b407594ce210,Dataset,

The Chesapeake Bay Watershed, located in the Mid-Atlantic Region of the United States, is experiencing rapid habitat loss and fragmentation from sprawling low-density development. The bay itself is heavily stressed by excess sediment and nutrient runoff. Three states, the District of Columbia, and the federal government signed an agreement in 2000 to address these problems. The commitments included an assessment of the watershed's resource lands, and targeting the most valued lands for protection. As part of this task, the Resource Lands Assessment identified an ecological network comprised of large contiguous blocks (hubs) of forests, wetlands, and streams, interconnected by corridors to allow animal and plant propagule dispersal and migration. Hubs were prioritized by ecoregion, by analyzing a variety of ecological parameters, including: rare species presence, rarity and population viability; vegetation and vertebrate richness; habitat area, condition, and diversity; intactness and remoteness; connectivity potential; and the nature of the surrounding landscape. I found that much of the watershed was still fairly intact, although this varied dramatically by ecoregion. Current protection also varied, and an assessment of vulnerability will help focus protection efforts among the most valuable hubs and corridors.

The imagery was collected between April 24, 2002 and September 12, 2002. The approximate scale is 1:100,000 with a ground resolution of 30 meters by 30 meters. The CDL emphasis is on agricultural land cover. The area of coverage is the entire State of Maryland This land cover dataset is part of a one-time series in which ten Mid-Atlantic States were categorized based on the extensive field observations collected during the 2002 annual NASS June Agricultural Survey. No farmer reported data is included or derivable from the Cropland Data Layer. The area of coverage for the 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL includes the entire states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and West Virginia. The funding for this project was shared between the USDA-NASS and Towson State University. The 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL is currently a special one-time project. However, the possibility does exist to establish an annual cropland data layer for any state that shows significant interest and can offer an in-state cooperative agreement with another federal, state, local, or university agency or group. If interested, please contact the Section Head of the USDA-NASS Spatial Analysis Research Section at 703/877-8000.

The imagery was collected between April 24, 2002 and September 12, 2002. The approximate scale is 1:100,000 with a ground resolution of 30 meters by 30 meters. The CDL emphasis is on agricultural land cover. The area of coverage is the entire State of West Virginia. This land cover dataset is part of a one-time series in which ten Mid-Atlantic States were categorized based on the extensive field observations collected during the 2002 annual NASS June Agricultural Survey. No farmer reported data is included or derivable from the Cropland Data Layer. The area of coverage for the 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL includes the entire states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and West Virginia. The funding for this project was shared between the USDA-NASS and Towson State University. The 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL is currently a special one-time project. However, the possibility does exist to establish an annual cropland data layer for any state that shows significant interest and can offer an in-state cooperative agreement with another federal, state, local, or university agency or group. If interested, please contact the Section Head of the USDA-NASS Spatial Analysis Research Section at 703/877-8000.

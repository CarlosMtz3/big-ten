Physiography is the study and classification of the natural landscape of the earth and the landforms that comprise it. The approach for the detailed physiographic map of Maryland is hierarchical and descriptive. Subdivisions are based on similarities (within) and differences (among) geologic structure, rock type, geomorphic history, and topographic characteristics. Data and subdivisions were compiled at a 1:100,000 scale for the detailed state-wide map. The hierarchical classification of the detailed physiographic map (in progress) includes subdivisions as follows, in descending order (and generally decreasing size): Province, Section, Region, District, Area. In Maryland there are portions of five physiographic Provinces. In this file, the polygons reflect Province level subdivision. The polygon feature attribute table has been developed to pertain only to the Provinces level.

Hydrologic units through four levels were created in the 1970's and have been used extensively throughout the United States. During that time the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) developed a hierarchical hydrologic unit code (HUC) for Hydrologic unit boundaries define the aerial extent of surface water drainage to a point. Hydrologic units through four levels were created in the 1970's and have been used extensively throughout the United States. During that time the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) developed a hierarchical hydrologic unit code (HUC) for the United States. This system divides the country into 21 Regions, 222 Subregions, 352 Accounting Units, and 2,149 Cataloging Units based on surface hydrologic features. The smallest USGS unit (8-digit HU) is approximately 448,000 acres. During the late 1970's the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), formerly the Soil Conservation Service, initiated a national program to further subdivide HU's into smaller watersheds for water resources planning. A 3-digit extension was added to the 8-digit identification. By the early 1980's this 11-digit HU mapping was completed for most of the U.S. These data demonstrate Maryland's watersheds as represented by the federal Hydrologic Unit Code denoted by an 11-digit numerical code. The watersheds were defined using contours on U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5 minute quadrangle map sheets. The state has been divided into 138 watersheds that are identified by Maryland, using an 8-digit numerical code. These watersheds are equivalent to the HUC 11-digit codes. The watershed file is generally considered to be map accurate at a scale of 1:24,000.

Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets. However, census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area. A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints, along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks. As a result, all 2010 Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic area, so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas.

Inputs to the model included 6 physical variables (geomorphology, elevation, sea level rise, wave power, storm surge height and erosion rates) and 5 habitat types (forest, marsh, dune, oyster reef and underwater grass). Two scenarios of the model were run: one scenario incorporating the protective role of all existing coastal habitats and the other scenario simulating the complete loss of habitats. The difference between the two scenarios indicates the potential magnitude of coastal hazard reduction by habitats at each location. Model results were integrated with MD DNR's Community Flood Risk Areas (March, 2016) in order to highlight areas where hazard reduction by habitats is most likely to benefit at-risk coastal communities.This dataset was produced under award number NA13NOS4190136 from the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through the Maryland Department of Natural Resources Chesapeake and Coastal Services (CCS).

The source data were collected on-transect (120m width, 60 m each side) for transects conducted in the mouth of Chesapeake Bay, in Delaware Bay, and in offshore waters from the beach outward. Aerial surveys of waterbirds were flown to at least 12 nautical miles (22.2 km) offshore from northern New Jersey to the Virginia / North Carolina border.

This was done to verify that the graphic representations were accurate. These data sets were then converted to raster format and reclassified with a rank determined by DNR biologists. This rank determines level of habitat importance with spawning areas ranking highest and adult areas of bay depth below 3 feet ranking the lowest.

MGS contracted the services of EarthData International, Inc. (EDI), currently of Frederick, Md., to extract shorelines from an existing wetlands delineation, which was based on photo interpretation of 3.75-minute digital orthophoto quarter quads (DOQQs). In areas where a wetlands coverage was not yet available, EDI interpreted shorelines directly from the orthophotography. DOQQ registration (Maryland State Plane Coordinate System, NAD 83, meters) was transferred automatically to the shoreline vectors. Following shoreline extraction or interpretation, EDI assigned attributes to the vectors based on shoreline type: beach, vegetated, structure, or water's edge. All four categories are linear features, except beach, which, if sufficiently wide, can be both linear and polygonal. Shorelines were merged into 7.5-minute quadrangles, provided that the aerial photography on which the DOQQs were based was flown in the same year. MGS used the shorelines to create a series of Shoreline Changes maps. In doing so, MGS erased the landward edge of beach polygons, leaving the seaward edge intact as a linear feature. The Geographic Information Services Division of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) merged the shorelines for all of the 7.5-minute quadrangles into a single, statewide coverage. MGS, working collaboratively with Towson University's Center for Geographic Sciences (CGIS), subsequently used the recent shorelines, along with historical ones, as input into a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) program, the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) (Danforth and Thieler, 1992; Thieler and others, 2001). DSAS determines linear rates of shoreline change (erosion or accretion) along closely spaced, shore-normal transects. Based on DSAS output, the collaborators assigned the following erosion rate categories as attributes to the recent shoreline, clipped by county from the statewide coverage: a) High erosion rate (more than 8 ft/yr), b) Moderate erosion rate (4-8 ft/yr), c) Low erosion rate (2-4 ft/yr), d) Slight erosion rate (0-2 ft/yr), e) No change, f) Accretion, g) Protected, h) Unknown and i) No Data The DOQQs from which the shorelines were interpreted meet National Map Accuracy Standards at the production scale of 1:12,000 using the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing(ASPRS) method. Consider the scale in displaying and using the vectors. Displaying the vectors at scales larger than those of the source documents is considered bad practice. See Horizontal Positional Accuracy Report for positional inaccuracies in the data set. The aerial photography from which the DOQQs were developed was not tide-coordinated. Therefore, shoreline in this data set do not reprsent a consistent vertical datum.Last Updated:Feature Service Layer Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Hydrology/MD_ShorelineChanges/MapServer/1",2016-03-29T19:45:29Z,2016,[u'ArcGIS Online for Maryland'],bd328ca0-6022-4b26-a967-4fa0b94495a3,,37.9144 -77.2735 39.6127 -77.2735 39.6127 -75.0502 37.9144 -75.0502 37.9144 -77.2735,2016,[],bd328ca0-6022-4b26-a967-4fa0b94495a3,37.9144 -77.2735 39.6127 -75.0502,Shoreline Changes - Baseline: Maryland,Shapefile,"[u'Maryland, United States']",Maryland iMap,bd328ca0-6022-4b26-a967-4fa0b94495a3,Dataset,

Urban Land Uses: 11 Low-density residential - Detached single-family/duplex dwelling units, yards and associated areas. Areas of more than 90 percent single-family/duplex dwelling units, with lot sizes of less than five acres but at least one-half acre (.2 dwelling units/acre to 2 dwelling units/acre). 12 Medium-density residential - Detached single-family/duplex, attached single-unit row housing, yards, and associated areas. Areas of more than 90 percent single-family/duplex units and attached single-unit row housing, with lot sizes of less than one-half acre but at least one-eighth acre (2 dwelling units/acre to 8 dwelling units/acre). 13 High-density residential - Attached single-unit row housing, garden apartments, high-rise apartments/condominiums, mobile home and trailer parks; areas of more than 90 percent high-density residential units, with more than 8 dwelling units per acre. 14 Commercial - Retail and wholesale services. Areas used primarily for the sale of products and services, including associated yards and parking areas. 15 Industrial - Manufacturing and industrial parks, including associated warehouses, storage yards, research laboratories, and parking areas. 16 Institutional - Elementary and secondary schools, middle schools, junior and senior high schools, public and private colleges and universities, military installations (built-up areas only, including buildings and storage, training, and similar areas), churches, medical and health facilities, correctional facilities, and government offices and facilities that are clearly separable from the surrounding land cover. 17 Extractive - Surface mining operations, including sand and gravel pits, quarries, coal surface mines, and deep coal mines. Status of activity (active vs. abandoned) is not distinguished. 18 Open urban land - Urban areas whose use does not require structures, or urban areas where non-conforming uses characterized by open land have become isolated. Included are golf courses, parks, recreation areas (except areas associated with schools or other institutions), cemeteries, and entrapped agricultural and undeveloped land within urban areas. 191 Large lot subdivision (agriculture) - Residential subdivisions with lot sizes of less than 20 acres but at least 5 acres, with a dominant land cover of open fields or pasture. 192 Large lot subdivision (forest) - Residential subdivisions with lot sizes of less than 20 acres but at least 5 acres, with a dominant land cover of deciduous, evergreen or mixed forest. Agriculture: 21 Cropland - Field crops and forage crops. 22 Pasture - Land used for pasture, both permanent and rotated; grass. 23 Orchards/vineyards/horticulture - Areas of intensively managed commercial bush and tree crops, including areas used for fruit production, vineyards, sod and seed farms, nurseries, and green houses. 24 Feeding operations - Cattle feed lots, holding lots for animals, hog feeding lots, poultry houses, and commercial fishing areas (including oyster beds). 241 Feeding operations - Cattle feed lots, holding lots for animals, hog feeding lots, poultry houses. 242 Agricultural building breeding and training facilities, storage facilities, built-up areas associated with a farmstead, small farm ponds, commercial fishing areas. 25 Row and garden crops - Intensively managed truck and vegetable farms and associated areas. Forest: 41 Deciduous forest - Forested areas in which the trees characteristically lose their leaves at the end of the growing season. Included are such species as oak, hickory, aspen, sycamore, birch, yellow poplar, elm, maple, and cypress. 42 Evergreen forest - Forested areas in which the trees are characterized by persistent foliage throughout the year. Included are such species as white pine, pond pine, hemlock, southern white cedar, and red pine. 43 Mixed forest - Forested areas in which neither deciduous nor evergreen species dominate, but in which there is a combination of both types. 44 Brush - Areas which do not produce timber or other wood products but may have cut-over timber stands, abandoned agriculture fields, or pasture. These areas are characterized by vegetation types such as sumac, vines, rose, brambles, and tree seedlings. Water: 50 Water - Rivers, waterways, reservoirs, ponds, bays, estuaries, and ocean. Wetlands: 60 Wetlands - Forested or non-forested wetlands, including tidal flats, tidal and non-tidal marshes, and upland swamps and wet areas. Barren Land: 70 Barren land 71 Beaches - Extensive shoreline areas of sand and gravel accumulation, with no vegetative cover or other land use. 72 Bare exposed rock - Areas of bedrock exposure, scarps, and other natural accumulations of rock without vegetative cover. 73 Bare ground - Areas of exposed ground caused naturally, by construction, or by other cultural processes.

Knowledge of the timing and strength of tidal currents is extremely important for safe navigation in coastal waters. Tidal currents are almost always the strongest current experienced by vessels operating offshore and for considerable distances inside bays and river estuaries. Standardized procedures exist for analyzing tidal current data to separate the tidal and nontidal parameters. The tidal parameters are used to produce the National Ocean Service Tidal Current Tables. There are currently 41 tidal current reference stations where daily predictions are made based on information obtained in short-term current studies. Additional predictions are made for 2200 locations referenced to these tidal current reference stations. Predictions have varying degrees of accuracy dependant on the age of the data, the length of the measurements and the degree of non tidal influence a given location experiences. A clear understanding of current patterns in ports and estuaries which have economical and commercial importance is vital to ensure safe navigation and help in preventing accidents. In ports where currents are dominated by non-tidal factors, real-time current measurements are preferred.

Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to reassign to the Natural Resources Conservation Service any authority for the decisions that they make. The Natural Resources Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these maps for purposes related solely to State or local regulatory programs. Photographic or digital enlargement of these maps to scales greater than at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation of the data. If enlarged, maps do not show the small areas of contrasting soils that could have been shown at a larger scale. The depicted soil boundaries, interpretations, and analysis derived from them do not eliminate the need for onsite sampling, testing, and detailed study of specific sites for intensive uses. Thus, these data and their interpretations are intended for planning purposes only. Digital data files are periodically updated. Files are dated, and users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the data.The attribute accuracy is tested by manual comparison of the source with hard copy plots and/or symbolized display of the map data on an interactive computer graphic system. Selected attributes that cannot be visually verified on plots or on screen are interactively queried and verified on screen. In addition, the attributes are tested against a master set of valid attributes.

These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access, land acquisition, and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses, as well as Maryland's growing coastal population, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.Last Updated: 07/01/2014Feature Service Layer Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Society/MD_RecreationalUses/FeatureServer/27",2016-04-06T16:16:21.000ZZ,2016,[u'ArcGIS Online for Maryland'],7d8ca702-da3d-4ddc-ab75-0592adcd9c3b,,37.9511 -79.4696 39.7216 -79.4696 39.7216 -74.8579 37.9511 -74.8579 37.9511 -79.4696,2016,[],7d8ca702-da3d-4ddc-ab75-0592adcd9c3b,37.9511 -79.4696 39.7216 -74.8579,"Recreational Uses - Motorized Boating: Maryland, 2016",Shapefile,"[u'Maryland, United States']",Maryland iMap,7d8ca702-da3d-4ddc-ab75-0592adcd9c3b,Dataset,

The Program coordinates the acquisition of lands for the use of all units of DNR. Stateside POS funds are allocated to purchase land for state parks, forests, wildlife habitat, natural, scenic and cultural resources for public use. A portion of stateside funds are also dedicated to capital improvements, critical maintenance, and operations in state parks. Stateside POS projects are now being driven by a new Targeting System, which uses the best scientific information available to target the program's limited funds. In the case of a project with multiple parcels, the Identify results will indicate the total acreage and BPW amount for the project.

For extent acquracies please contact the project lead for each study. Secondary habitats were delineated using sandy beach data from VIMS and salinity data from Lee Karrh of DNR. Sandy beach areas were selected and exported from the source file and then combined with the salinity data to determine sensitivity importance levels. These data sets were then converted to raster format and reclassified with a rank determined by DNR biologists. This rank determines level of habitat importance with spawning areas ranking highest and adult areas of bay depth below 3 feet ranking the lowest.

These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access, land acquisition, and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses, as well as Maryland's growing coastal population, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.Last Updated: 07/01/2014Feature Service Layer Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Society/MD_RecreationalUses/FeatureServer/10",2016-04-06T15:38:42.000ZZ,2016,[u'ArcGIS Online for Maryland'],58e761d4-a0e6-442b-8b2f-7496a98c3b72,,38.5726 -76.3404 38.7903 -76.3404 38.7903 -75.9658 38.5726 -75.9658 38.5726 -76.3404,2016,[],58e761d4-a0e6-442b-8b2f-7496a98c3b72,38.5726 -76.3404 38.7903 -75.9658,"Recreational Uses - For Hire Educational Cruises: Maryland, 2016",Shapefile,"[u'Maryland, United States']",Maryland iMap,58e761d4-a0e6-442b-8b2f-7496a98c3b72,Dataset,

To do so, we identified five key questions to assess each marsh: How much is the marsh able to reduce the impact of coastal hazards?Is the marsh located where coastal hazards are a threat?Is the marsh located where there are people to protect? Is the marsh located adjacent to other protective habitats?Is the marsh likely to survive in the face of rising sea levels?Using data from the Coastal Resiliency Assessment and other sources, we developed metrics to score each marsh on these five questions. Then, the sub-scores were combined to create the Marsh Protection Potential Index overall rating, which ranks the protective ability of over 14,000 marshes statewide.It is important to note that the MPPI ranks marshes relative to other marshes, rather than providing an absolute measure of protective services. The Marsh Protection Potential Index does not attempt to describe the dollar-value of protective services provided by each marsh, nor does it compare marshes to other types of habitat or to other protection infrastructure solutions. In addition, the MPPI does not assess marshes on any of the other characteristics that often inform conservation priorities. Things like biodiversity, ecosystem health, rare species, recreation value, or water quality services are often important to stakeholders, and these are not captured by the MPPI. The MPPI is intended to supplement, not replace, the other ways conservation decision-makers prioritize natural habitats.Last Updated: 3/31/2016Feature Service Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Environment/MD_CoastalResiliencyAssessment/FeatureServer/3",2016-05-31T16:30:29.000ZZ,2016,[u'ArcGIS Online for Maryland'],680aea90-0b8e-4db7-b10c-0366b1a86186,,37.9121 -77.2675 39.6152 -77.2675 39.6152 -75.0574 37.9121 -75.0574 37.9121 -77.2675,2016,[],680aea90-0b8e-4db7-b10c-0366b1a86186,37.9121 -77.2675 39.6152 -75.0574,Marsh Protection Potential Index: Maryland,Shapefile,"[u'Maryland, United States']",Maryland iMap,680aea90-0b8e-4db7-b10c-0366b1a86186,Dataset,

The Program coordinates the acquisition of lands for the use of all units of DNR.

A portion of stateside funds are also dedicated to capital improvements, critical maintenance, and operations in state parks.

The DNR Lands data (part of Technology Toolbox Protected Lands data set) consists of mapped information that represent those lands that are owned by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.Utilizing various land protection programs and funding sources, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources has preserved environmentally important lands through the use of perpetual conservation easements. The Forest Legacy Program is designed to identify and protect environmentally important forest lands that are threatened by present or future conversion to non-forest use through the use of perpetual conservation easements between willing sellers and willing buyers. Only private forest land in a Forest Legacy Area is eligible for the program. Marylands Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) has helped thousands of Maryland landowners plant streamside buffers, establish wetlands, protect highly erodible land, and create wildlife habitat. The State of Maryland has entered into a memorandum of Agreement with USDA authorizing the State of Maryland to continue the voluntary program for the purchase of perpetual easements for Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land. A perpetual CREP easement is a written legal agreement between a landowner and the State of Maryland in which there is an acquired permanent interest in the land to install or maintain conservation practices that protect water quality and natural resources. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) administers the CREP easement program. DNR is also assisted by a number of local governments and non-government organization sponsors.Last Updated: 05/2014Feature Service Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Environment/MD_ProtectedLands/FeatureServer/0",2016-02-09T17:22:44.000ZZ,2016,[u'ArcGIS Online for Maryland'],181b4655-ee27-4119-9f6b-be04bbbae711,,37.912 -79.4828 39.7229 -79.4828 39.7229 -75.0511 37.912 -75.0511 37.912 -79.4828,2016,[],181b4655-ee27-4119-9f6b-be04bbbae711,37.912 -79.4828 39.7229 -75.0511,Protected Lands - DNR Owned Properties and Conservation Easements: Maryland,Shapefile,"[u'Maryland, United States']",Maryland iMap,181b4655-ee27-4119-9f6b-be04bbbae711,Dataset,

The Green Infrastructure Assessment was developed to provide decision support for Maryland's Department of Natural Resources land conservation programs. Methods used to identify and rank green infrastructure lands are intended soley for this use. Other applications are at the discretion of the user. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources is not responsible for any inaccuracies in the data and does not necessarily endorse any uses or products derived from the data other than those for which the data were originally intended. Maryland's green infrastructure is a network of undeveloped lands that provide the bulk of the state's natural support system. Ecosystem services, such as cleaning the air, filtering water, storing and cycling nutrients, conserving soils, regulating climate, and maintaining hydrologic function, are all provided by the existing expanses of forests, wetlands, and other natural lands. These ecologically valuable lands also provide marketable goods and services, like forest products, fish and wildlife, and recreation. The Green Infrastructure serves as vital habitat for wild species and contributes in many ways to the health and quality of life for Maryland residents. To identify and prioritize Maryland's green infrastructure, we developed a tool called the Green Infrastructure Assessment (GIA). The GIA was based on principles of landscape ecology and conservation biology, and provides a consistent approach to evaluating land conservation and restoration efforts in Maryland. It specifically attempts to recognize: a variety of natural resource values (as opposed to a single species of wildlife, for example), how a given place fits into a larger system, the ecological importance of natural open space in rural and developed areas, the importance of coordinating local, state and even interstate planning, and the need for a regional or landscape-level view for wildlife conservation. The GIA identified two types of important resource lands - NhubsN and Ncorridors.N Gaps are developed, agricultural, mined, or cleared lands within the Green infrastructure network that could be targeted for restoration. These were evaluated for their potential restoration to forest, wetland, or riparian buffers, by considering watershed condition, landscape position, local features, ownership, and programmatic considerations. Gaps with hydric soils were probably once wetlands, and could be restored as such. Reforestation of gaps along streams would not only benefit wildlife, but improve water quality and stream stability.

It is also important to note that in some cases, due to the way the data was processed, outfalls and facilities may have the same coordinates, leading to points being stacked.Last Updated: 09/27/2013Feature Service Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Environment/MD_PointSourceDischarges/FeatureServer/1",2016-02-09T17:19:55.000ZZ,2016,[u'ArcGIS Online for Maryland'],cd371570-e3dd-411c-9e41-b2a49d243ce8,,37.9664 -79.4639 39.7205 -79.4639 39.7205 -75.0706 37.9664 -75.0706 37.9664 -79.4639,2016,[],cd371570-e3dd-411c-9e41-b2a49d243ce8,37.9664 -79.4639 39.7205 -75.0706,Point Source Discharges - Point Source Discharges: Maryland,Shapefile,"[u'Maryland, United States']",Maryland iMap,cd371570-e3dd-411c-9e41-b2a49d243ce8,Dataset,

Stateside POS funds are allocated to purchase land for state parks, forests, wildlife habitat, natural, scenic and cultural resources for public use. A portion of stateside funds are also dedicated to capital improvements, critical maintenance, and operations in state parks. Stateside POS projects are now being driven by a new Targeting System, which uses the best scientific information available to target the program's limited funds.

The service depicts the number of broadband service providers per census block and the layer represents the National Telecommunications Information Administration (NTIA) State Broadband Data Development Program (SBDD) area of broadband availability. The number of broadband providers per census block is illustrated. Area of broadband availability refers to those individual US Census Blocks, less than 2 square miles, where each facilities-based provider of broadband service can provide broadband services of minimal characteristics within 7 - 10 business days. For this purpose, 'broadband service' is the provision, on either a commercial or non-commercial basis, of data transmission technology that provides two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end users, or providing sufficient capacity in a middle mile project to support the provision of broadband service to end-users within the project area. For this purpose, an 'end user' of broadband service is a residential or business party, institution or State or local government entity that may use broadband service for its own purposes and that does not resell such service to other entities or incorporate such service into retail Internet-access services. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are not 'end users' for this purpose. An entity is a 'facilities based' provider of broadband service connections to end user locations if any of the following conditions are met: (1) It owns the portion of the physical facility that terminates at the end user location; (2) it obtains unbundled network elements (UNEs), special access lines, or other leased facilities that terminate at the end user location and provisions/equips them as broadband; or (3) it provisions/equips a broadband wireless channel to the end user location over licensed or unlicensed spectrum. For this purpose, 'broadband service' is 'available' at an address if the provider does, or could, within a typical service interval (7 to 10 business days) without an extraordinary commitment of resources, provision two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end-users at that address.

The Green Infrastructure Assessment was developed to provide decision support for Maryland's Department of Natural Resources land conservation programs. Methods used to identify and rank green infrastructure lands are intended soley for this use. Other applications are at the discretion of the user. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources is not responsible for any inaccuracies in the data and does not necessarily endorse any uses or products derived from the data other than those for which the data were originally intended. Maryland's green infrastructure is a network of undeveloped lands that provide the bulk of the state's natural support system. Ecosystem services, such as cleaning the air, filtering water, storing and cycling nutrients, conserving soils, regulating climate, and maintaining hydrologic function, are all provided by the existing expanses of forests, wetlands, and other natural lands. These ecologically valuable lands also provide marketable goods and services, like forest products, fish and wildlife, and recreation. The Green Infrastructure serves as vital habitat for wild species and contributes in many ways to the health and quality of life for Maryland residents. To identify and prioritize Maryland's green infrastructure, we developed a tool called the Green Infrastructure Assessment (GIA). The GIA was based on principles of landscape ecology and conservation biology, and provides a consistent approach to evaluating land conservation and restoration efforts in Maryland. It specifically attempts to recognize: a variety of natural resource values (as opposed to a single species of wildlife, for example), how a given place fits into a larger system, the ecological importance of natural open space in rural and developed areas, the importance of coordinating local, state and even interstate planning, and the need for a regional or landscape-level view for wildlife conservation. The GIA identified two types of important resource lands - NhubsN and Ncorridors.N Hubs typically large contiguous areas, separated by major roads and/or human land uses, that contain one or more of the following: Large blocks of contiguous interior forest (containing at least 250 acres, plus a transition zone of 300 feet) Large wetland complexes, with at least 250 acres of unmodified wetlands; Important animal and plant habitats of at least 100 acres, including rare, threatened, and endangered species locations, unique ecological communities, and migratory bird habitats; relatively pristine stream and river segments (which, when considered with adjacent forests and wetlands, are at least 100 acres) that support trout, mussels, and other sensitive aquatic organisms; and existing protected natural resource lands which contain one or more of the above (for example, state parks and forests, National Wildlife Refuges, locally owned reservoir properties, major stream valley parks, and Nature Conservancy preserves). In the GIA model, the above features were identified from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) spatial data that covered the entire state. Developed areas and major roads were excluded, areas less than 100 contiguous acres were dropped, adjacent forest and wetland were added to the remaining hubs, and the edges were smoothed. The average size of all hubs in the state is approximately 2200 acres. Corridors are linear features connecting hubs together to help animals and plant propagules to move between hubs. Corridors were identified using many sets of data, including land cover, roads, streams, slope, flood plains, aquatic resource data, and fish blockages. Generally speaking, corridors connect hubs of similar type (hubs containing forests are connected to one another; while those consisting primarily of wetlands are connected to others containing wetlands). Corridors generally follow the best ecological or Nmost naturalN routes between hubs. Typically these are streams with wide riparian buffers and healthy fish communities. Other good wildlife corridors include ridge lines or forested valleys. Developed areas, major roads, and other unsuitable features were avoided.

The LIHTC program is defined in Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The LIHTC is a tax incentive intended to increase the availability of affordable rental housing. The LIHTC statute provides two criteria for QCT eligibility. A census tract must have either: 1) a poverty rate of at least 25 percent; or 2) 50 percent or more of its householders must have incomes below 60 percent of the area median household income. The area corresponds to a metropolitan or a non-metropolitan area. Further, the LIHTC statute requires that no more than 20 percent of the metropolitan area population reside within designated QCTs (This limit also applies collectively to the nonmetropolitan counties in each state). Thus, it is possible for a tract to meet one or both of the above criteria, but not be designated as a QCT. With respect to the census tracts, the Census Bureau defines them in cooperation with local authorities every ten years for the purposes of the decennial census and, following a public comment period, has recently completed defining tract boundaries for the 2010 Census. Note that when census tract boundaries are set, they remain unchanged for the next decade. Thus, tract boundaries will not be changed until the 2020 Decennial Census.Last Updated: 03/2016Feature Service Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/BusinessEconomy/MD_HousingDesignatedAreas/FeatureServer/1",2016-03-04T16:34:04.000ZZ,2016,[u'ArcGIS Online for Maryland'],f8125e69-ece9-4bf6-8e89-4ff959700670,,37.9551 -79.4873 39.723 -79.4873 39.723 -75.5318 37.9551 -75.5318 37.9551 -79.4873,2016,[],f8125e69-ece9-4bf6-8e89-4ff959700670,37.9551 -79.4873 39.723 -75.5318,Housing Designated Areas - Qualified Census Tracts: Maryland,Shapefile,"[u'Maryland, United States']",Maryland iMap,f8125e69-ece9-4bf6-8e89-4ff959700670,Dataset,

Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses, as well as Maryland's growing coastal population, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized.

Fifteen points were found that were not consistent with the surrounding data and were removed prior to tinning. DEM grid values outside the shoreline (on land) were assigned null values (-32676). Chesapeake Bay has two hundred eighteen 7.5 minute DEMs and ten one degree DEMs. The 1 degree DEMs were generated from the higher resolution 7.5 minute DEMs which covered the estuary. A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) contains a series of elevations ordered from south to north with the order of the columns from west to east. The DEM is formatted as one ASCII header record (A- record), followed by a series of profile records (B- records) each of which include a short B-record header followed by a series of ASCII integer elevations (typically in units of 1 centimeter) per each profile. The last physical record of the DEM is an accuracy record (C- record). The 7.5-minute DEM (30- by 30-m data spacing) is cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection. It provides coverage in 7.5- by 7.5-minute blocks. Each product provides the same coverage as a standard USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle but the DEM contains over edge data. Coverage is available for many estuaries of the contiguous United States but is not complete.This layer was modified from its original form. Please see lineage section for details.Not to be used for Navigation. Acknowledgment of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration- Nation Ocean Service would be appreciated in products derived from these data. The datum for these bathymetric DEMs is not the same as that used by the US Geological survey (USGS) for land based DEMs which results in a discontinuity if the two datasets are merged together. Moreover, the shoreline for the USGS DEMs is indeterminate and not the same as that used for the Bathymetric DEMs. The data within the bathymetry file is floating point.

Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses, as well as Maryland's growing coastal population, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.Last Updated: 07/01/2014Feature Service Layer Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Society/MD_RecreationalUses/FeatureServer/50",2016-04-06T17:01:51.000ZZ,2016,[u'ArcGIS Online for Maryland'],b4cdceb5-85ba-4208-b371-3a8229d80182,,38.3025 -77.3819 39.0315 -77.3819 39.0315 -75.7571 38.3025 -75.7571 38.3025 -77.3819,2016,[],b4cdceb5-85ba-4208-b371-3a8229d80182,38.3025 -77.3819 39.0315 -75.7571,"Recreational Uses - Wildlife Viewing: Maryland, 2016",Shapefile,"[u'Maryland, United States']",Maryland iMap,b4cdceb5-85ba-4208-b371-3a8229d80182,Dataset,

These areas represent the most ecologically valuable areas in the State: they are the Nbest of the bestN. TEAs are preferred for conservation funding through Stateside Program Open Space. This version updates the 2008 TEA layer. The first step in updating TEAs was to create an ecological baseline composed of several ecological databases which included updates of original databases and additional databases developed since 2008.The first component is the updated Green Infrastructure Assessment (circa 2010) which identifies large, contiguous blocks (hubs) of significant forests and wetlands and their connecting corridors. The Green Infrastructure's hub and corridor network of habitat allows plant and animal migration, reduces forest fragmentation if protected, and provides important ecosystem services, such as biodiversity, cleaning air and water, storing nutrients, and protecting areas against storm and flood damage.The rare species and wildlife habitat component identifies areas that support Rare, Threatened, and Endangered Species, rare plant and animal communities, species of Greatest Conservation Need, and wildlife concentrations.The aquatic life hotspots component identifies watersheds supporting freshwater stream ecosystems where conservation is needed to protect and restore areas of high aquatic biodiversity, Tier II regulated streams, and brook trout streams.The water quality protection component identifies sensitive lands such as forests, wetlands, and steep slopes where preservation is important for water quality.The coastal ecosystems component identifies Blue Infrastructure shoreline and watershed protection priorities. These are areas important for sustaining coastal and tidal ecosystems and also identifies land areas important for sustaining spawning and nursery areas for important commercial and recreational fisheries.The climate change adaptation component identifies areas important for sustaining wetlands ecosystems that are changing and moving landward in response to sea level rise.From the ecological baseline, areas that ranked as most important for each of the components were merged to create the Targeted Ecological Areas. Lands that were developed, as identified by the Maryland Department of Planning (2010) were removed from the TEA layer since developed lands are not preferred for Stateside Program Open Space funding. Additionally, lands that are in the 0 foot to 2 foot inundation zone based on the 2011 SLAMM (Maryland Sea-Level Affecting Marshes Model) study performed for all 16 coastal counties and Baltimore City since these areas are not preferred for Stateside Program Open Space funding.Feature Service Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Environment/MD_FocalAreas/FeatureServer/1",2016-02-09T17:12:28.000ZZ,2016,[u'ArcGIS Online for Maryland'],fcbedf6e-1422-46d4-af02-c466c2beace1,,37.9217 -79.4871 39.7231 -79.4871 39.7231 -75.0592 37.9217 -75.0592 37.9217 -79.4871,2016,[],fcbedf6e-1422-46d4-af02-c466c2beace1,37.9217 -79.4871 39.7231 -75.0592,Focal Areas - Targeted Ecological Areas: Maryland,Shapefile,"[u'Maryland, United States']",Maryland iMap,fcbedf6e-1422-46d4-af02-c466c2beace1,Dataset,

An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population. Places always nest within a State, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries. An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions. CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the State in which they are located. The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with State, local, and/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity. CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs for the 2010 Census is that they must contain some housing and population. The boundaries of all 2010 Census incorporated places are as of January 1, 2010 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).

NTransfer of Development Rights (TDR) is a voluntary, incentive-based program that allows landowners to sell development rights from their land to a developer or other interested party who then can use these rights to increase the density of development at another designated location. While the seller of development rights still owns the land and can continue using it, an easement is placed on the property that prevents further development. A TDR program protects land resources at the same time providing additional income to both the landowner and the holder of the development rights.N Source: https://www.uwsp.edu/cnr-ap/clue/Documents/PlanImplementation/Transfer_of_Development_Rights.pdf The Purchase of Development Rights (PDR) is a voluntary program in which a land trust or a local, county or state agency buys the development rights on a parcel of land, primarily agricultural. PDRs Npermanently extinguish all preexisting development potential of a particular property and are not used to offset development elsewhere in the county. Other than very limited rights reserved to the original grantor and their immediate family, no further commercial or residential subdivision is allowed.

The quality control feature of the system allow data edit checks and validation for data from the 84 permanent, continuous automatic traffic recorders (ATRs) and short-term traffic counts.The Maryland Traffic Volume Maps depict the Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) at various locations on Maryland's roadways by county. Traffic Volume data is collected from over 8700 program count stations and 84 ATRs, located throughout Maryland. To date, four (4) ATRs have been removed from the ATR Program. Program count data is collected (both directions) at regular locations on either a three (3) year or six (6) year cycle depending on type of roadway. Growth Factors are applied to counts which were not taken during the current year and the counts are factored based on the past yearly growth of an associated ATR. Counters are placed for 48 hours on a Monday or Tuesday and are picked up that Thursday or Friday, respectively. The ATR and toll count data is collected on a continuous basis. Toll station data is provided by the Maryland Transportation Authority. A special numeric code was added to the AADT numbers, starting in 2006, to identify the years when the count was actually taken. The last digit represents the number of years prior to the actual count.

Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses, as well as Maryland's growing coastal population, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters.

These baseline recreational use data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access, land acquisition, future planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways the Chesapeake waters and surrounding lands are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses, as well as Maryland's growing coastal population, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.Last Updated: 7/1/2014Feature Service Layer Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Society/MD_RecreationalUses/FeatureServer/0",2016-04-04T17:53:37.000ZZ,2016,[u'ArcGIS Online for Maryland'],bce76116-06b8-4c02-8e79-58e7e59bd51e,,38.35 -79.4873 39.723 -79.4873 39.723 -76.9778 38.35 -76.9778 38.35 -79.4873,2016,[],bce76116-06b8-4c02-8e79-58e7e59bd51e,38.35 -79.4873 39.723 -76.9778,"Recreational Uses - Camping: Maryland, 2016",Shapefile,"[u'Maryland, United States']",Maryland iMap,bce76116-06b8-4c02-8e79-58e7e59bd51e,Dataset,

These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access, land acquisition, and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses, as well as Maryland's growing coastal population, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.Last Updated: 07/01/2014Feature Service Layer Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Society/MD_RecreationalUses/FeatureServer/45",2016-04-06T16:53:31.000ZZ,2016,[u'ArcGIS Online for Maryland'],d7d108be-8c64-49e5-85ab-6c451d3fe99b,,38.0086 -77.3819 38.8679 -77.3819 38.8679 -75.0755 38.0086 -75.0755 38.0086 -77.3819,2016,[],d7d108be-8c64-49e5-85ab-6c451d3fe99b,38.0086 -77.3819 38.8679 -75.0755,"Recreational Uses - Scenic Natural Views: Maryland, 2016",Shapefile,"[u'Maryland, United States']",Maryland iMap,d7d108be-8c64-49e5-85ab-6c451d3fe99b,Dataset,

By combining a sophisticated numerical weather model capable of simulating large-scale wind patterns with a microscale wind flow model responsive to local terrain and surface conditions, they enable the mapping of wind resources with much greater accuracy than has been possible in the past. In addition, they do not require surface wind data to make accurate predictions. While on-site measurements will be required to confirm the predicted wind resource at any particular location, mesoscale-microscale modeling can greatly reduce the time and cost required to identify and evaluate potential wind project sites. This map was created by AWS Truepower, LLC using the MesoMap system and historical weather data.

Some watersheds drainage areas were defined for streams less than third order and some large area watershed were split to maintain a maximum size of 15,000 acres. The watershed boundaries in this file were developed in a joint state and federal effort to create a consistent watershed file for use by all government agencies with an interest in Maryland's watersheds.

Shorelines were derived from three sources: (1) maps from a Historical Shorelines and Erosion Rates Atlas (Conkwright, 1975), (2) Coastal Survey maps (topographic or T-sheets) produced by the National Ocean Service (NOS), a branch of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and (3) a digital wetlands delineation based on photo interpretation of digital orthophoto quarter quads. DSAS constructed a baseline landward of and approximately parallel to the shorelines, inserted nodes every 20 m along the baseline, and cast straight-line transects from each node, perpendicular to the baseline, across the shorelines.

Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses, as well as Maryland's growing coastal population, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters.

These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access, land acquisition, and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses, as well as Maryland's growing coastal population, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.Last Updated: 07/01/2014Feature Service Layer Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Society/MD_RecreationalUses/FeatureServer/29",2016-04-06T16:21:46.000ZZ,2016,[u'ArcGIS Online for Maryland'],5cef731f-0949-44d8-9414-41892c9ea37d,,38.5519 -76.3437 38.9867 -76.3437 38.9867 -75.7896 38.5519 -75.7896 38.5519 -76.3437,2016,[],5cef731f-0949-44d8-9414-41892c9ea37d,38.5519 -76.3437 38.9867 -75.7896,"Recreational Uses - Muskrat Trapping: Maryland, 2016",Shapefile,"[u'Maryland, United States']",Maryland iMap,5cef731f-0949-44d8-9414-41892c9ea37d,Dataset,

These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access, land acquisition, and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses, as well as Maryland's growing coastal population, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.Last Updated: 7/1/2014Feature Service Layer Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Society/MD_RecreationalUses/FeatureServer/34",2016-04-06T16:32:27.000ZZ,2016,[u'ArcGIS Online for Maryland'],7322549b-8ce3-4ea2-9f8c-52edc6ff701a,,38.0137 -79.4911 39.7303 -79.4911 39.7303 -74.9152 38.0137 -74.9152 38.0137 -79.4911,2016,[],7322549b-8ce3-4ea2-9f8c-52edc6ff701a,38.0137 -79.4911 39.7303 -74.9152,"Recreational Uses - Recreational Hunting and Trapping: Maryland, 2016",Shapefile,"[u'Maryland, United States']",Maryland iMap,7322549b-8ce3-4ea2-9f8c-52edc6ff701a,Dataset,

The creation of this file goes back many years and involved several State and Federal agencies. This file was derived from a more detailed watershed file (Maryland's Third-Order Watershed). The process used to create this file is consistent with the elevation contour information found on the US Geological Survey's 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle maps and the Maryland Department of the Environment's watershed location and naming conventions. This file is similar, but not identical, to the US Natural Resources Conservation Service's (NRCS) Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC11) watershed file.

These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979).

These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery.

The data is essential in the planning, design and operation of the statewide road system and the development and implementation of state highway improvement and safety programs. TMS is a product of the ISTEA Act of 1991, which required a traffic data program to effectively and efficiently meet SHA's long-term traffic data monitoring and reporting requirements. The quality control feature of the system allow data edit checks and validation for data from the 84 permanent, continuous automatic traffic recorders (ATRs) and short-term traffic counts.The Maryland Traffic Volume Maps depict the Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) at various locations on Maryland's roadways by county. Traffic Volume data is collected from over 8700 program count stations and 84 ATRs, located throughout Maryland. To date, four (4) ATRs have been removed from the ATR Program. Program count data is collected (both directions) at regular locations on either a three (3) year or six (6) year cycle depending on type of roadway. Growth Factors are applied to counts which were not taken during the current year and the counts are factored based on the past yearly growth of an associated ATR. Counters are placed for 48 hours on a Monday or Tuesday and are picked up that Thursday or Friday, respectively. The ATR and toll count data is collected on a continuous basis. Toll station data is provided by the Maryland Transportation Authority. A special numeric code was added to the AADT numbers, starting in 2006, to identify the years when the count was actually taken. The last digit represents the number of years prior to the actual count. Where 0 represents the current year when data was collected (in 2014), 1 represents the count taken in 2013, 2 represents the count taken in 2012, 3 represents the count taken in 2011 and so forth.Last Updated:Feature Service Layer Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Transportation/MD_AnnualAverageDailyTraffic/FeatureServer/0",2016-04-05T18:09:29.000ZZ,2016,[u'ArcGIS Online for Maryland'],2175a39d-7875-4b59-a6f0-97327c40907d,,37.9718 -79.4863 39.7219 -79.4863 39.7219 -75.0525 37.9718 -75.0525 37.9718 -79.4863,2016,[],2175a39d-7875-4b59-a6f0-97327c40907d,37.9718 -79.4863 39.7219 -75.0525,Annual Average Daily Traffic - Annual Average Daily Traffic (SHA Statewide AADT Points): Maryland,Shapefile,"[u'Maryland, United States']",Maryland iMap,2175a39d-7875-4b59-a6f0-97327c40907d,Dataset,

Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses, as well as Maryland's growing coastal population, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.Last Updated: 07/01/2014Feature Service Layer Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Society/MD_RecreationalUses/FeatureServer/49",2016-04-06T17:00:18.000ZZ,2016,[u'ArcGIS Online for Maryland'],16de2e78-0aeb-4452-a615-aaccb334a024,,38.023 -76.3348 38.9867 -76.3348 38.9867 -75.0412 38.023 -75.0412 38.023 -76.3348,2016,[],16de2e78-0aeb-4452-a615-aaccb334a024,38.023 -76.3348 38.9867 -75.0412,"Recreational Uses - Swimming: Maryland, 2016",Shapefile,"[u'Maryland, United States']",Maryland iMap,16de2e78-0aeb-4452-a615-aaccb334a024,Dataset,

In the case of a project with multiple parcels, the Identify results will indicate the total acreage and BPW amount for the project. Hence, you will see the same acreage, BPW amount and TEA result for each part of the project. This file consists of stateside POS projects only.Last Updated: 2015Map Service Link:http://archive.geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Environment/MD_ArchivedProtectedLandsAcquisitions/MapServer/52",2016-05-12T17:32:34Z,2016,[u'ArcGIS Online for Maryland'],4e32409f-c614-42a2-8aca-367c92e532b9,,38.0646 -79.2976 39.668 -79.2976 39.668 -75.3404 38.0646 -75.3404 38.0646 -79.2976,2016,[],4e32409f-c614-42a2-8aca-367c92e532b9,38.0646 -79.2976 39.668 -75.3404,Program Open Space 2015 Land Acquisitions General (Archived): Maryland,Shapefile,"[u'Maryland, United States']",Maryland iMap,4e32409f-c614-42a2-8aca-367c92e532b9,Dataset,

Collecting data on the variety of ways you use the Seaside Bays and Atlantic Ocean will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. State and federally managed waters of Maryland and the U.S. are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, shipping, military exercises, sand mining, habitat for wildlife, and recreation. With new and expanding coastal and ocean uses emerging such as energy production and increased shipping and considering Maryland coastal population is increasing, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for its Atlantic Coast and Coastal Bays.

SPARROW discriminates which watersheds are likely to contribute the highest nutrient and sediment loads to the Chesapeake Bay. - The Biological Restoration Initiative (BRI) targeting identifies biologically impaired waters that demonstrate a high potential for removal from Marylands 303(d) list of impaired waters. Their selection is based on evaluation using the Biological Listing Methodology results listed in Marylands 2008 Integrated Report, which sets a threshold for degradation within Marylands non-tidal freshwater streams using the index of biotic integrity (IBI) scores from sampled fish and benthic communities. These watersheds have been targeted primarily for 319(h) grant program, which has a goal of delisting impaired surface waters. - The Atlantic Coastal Bay watersheds were selected based on the pattern of trajectories of the water quality index (dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a, total nitrogen, total phosphorus) between 2001-2006 (http://ian.umces.edu/press/books/publication/93/shifting_sands_envi ronmental_and_cultural_change_in_maryland_s_coastal_bays_2009- 06-08/). Agricultural and urbanized watersheds were evaluated separately to identify the highest nutrient loading areas. For urban watersheds developed lands were analyzed, while agricultural watersheds were separated into cropland and animal production systems.Last Updated: 2014Map Service Link:http://archive.geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Environment/MD_ArchivedTrustFund/MapServer/0",2016-06-16T13:32:58.000ZZ,2016,[u'ArcGIS Online for Maryland'],1e6c788b-c88f-490f-8e1f-2ca712ec7bfc,,37.9066 -79.4873 39.7229 -79.4873 39.7229 -75.0507 37.9066 -75.0507 37.9066 -79.4873,2016,[],1e6c788b-c88f-490f-8e1f-2ca712ec7bfc,37.9066 -79.4873 39.7229 -75.0507,Trust Fund Priority Zones - Historic (Archived): Maryland,Shapefile,"[u'Maryland, United States']",Maryland iMap,1e6c788b-c88f-490f-8e1f-2ca712ec7bfc,Dataset,

These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access, land acquisition, and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses, as well as Maryland's growing coastal population, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.Last Updated: 07/01/2014Feature Service Layer Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Society/MD_RecreationalUses/FeatureServer/17",2016-04-06T15:54:20.000ZZ,2016,[u'ArcGIS Online for Maryland'],01e95b54-a223-4c43-9f1c-27023e3a23c1,,38.4513 -77.2821 38.6674 -77.2821 38.6674 -77.1241 38.4513 -77.1241 38.4513 -77.2821,2016,[],01e95b54-a223-4c43-9f1c-27023e3a23c1,38.4513 -77.2821 38.6674 -77.1241,"Recreational Uses - Guided Paddle Tours: Maryland, 2016",Shapefile,"[u'Maryland, United States']",Maryland iMap,01e95b54-a223-4c43-9f1c-27023e3a23c1,Dataset,

These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access, land acquisition, and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses, as well as Maryland's growing coastal population, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.Last Updated: 07/01/2014Feature Service Layer Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Society/MD_RecreationalUses/FeatureServer/19",2016-04-06T15:58:45.000ZZ,2016,[u'ArcGIS Online for Maryland'],f1c2e93f-be24-4b83-958e-bfcca5cf5d03,,38.466 -79.4829 39.7238 -79.4829 39.7238 -75.7896 38.466 -75.7896 38.466 -79.4829,2016,[],f1c2e93f-be24-4b83-958e-bfcca5cf5d03,38.466 -79.4829 39.7238 -75.7896,"Recreational Uses - Guided Scenic Viewing: Maryland, 2016",Shapefile,"[u'Maryland, United States']",Maryland iMap,f1c2e93f-be24-4b83-958e-bfcca5cf5d03,Dataset,

With new and expanding coastal and ocean uses emerging such as energy production and increased shipping and considering Maryland coastal population is increasing, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for its Atlantic Coast and Coastal Bays. So basic data on how we use our coastal waters will be collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.Last Updated: 07/01/2014Feature Service Layer Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Society/MD_RecreationalUses/FeatureServer/41",2016-04-06T16:46:38.000ZZ,2016,[u'ArcGIS Online for Maryland'],339188c8-1044-477e-b197-3a6fb9161c2c,,37.5975 -75.3819 38.4513 -75.3819 38.4513 -73.5408 37.5975 -73.5408 37.5975 -75.3819,2016,[],339188c8-1044-477e-b197-3a6fb9161c2c,37.5975 -75.3819 38.4513 -73.5408,"Recreational Uses - Recreational Wildlife Viewing: Maryland, 2016",Shapefile,"[u'Maryland, United States']",Maryland iMap,339188c8-1044-477e-b197-3a6fb9161c2c,Dataset,

Inputs to the model included 6 physical variables (geomorphology, elevation, sea level rise, wave power, storm surge height and erosion rates) and 5 habitat types (forest, marsh, dune, oyster reef and underwater grass). Two scenarios of the model were run: one scenario incorporating the protective role of all existing coastal habitats and the other scenario simulating the complete loss of habitats. The difference between the two scenarios indicates the potential magnitude of coastal hazard reduction by habitats at each location.

Alexander and others (1999) developed ERF1, which assessed the hydrologic integrity of the digital reach traces and calculated the mean water time-of-travel in river reaches and reservoirs. ERF1-2 serves as the foundation for SPARROW (Spatially Referenced Regressions (of nutrient transport) On Watershed) modeling. Within the context of a Geographic Information System, SPARROW estimates the proportion of watersheds in the conterminous U.S. with outflow concentrations of several nutrients, including total nitrogen and total phosphorus, (Smith, R.A., Schwarz, G.E., and Alexander, R.B., 1997). This version of the network expands on ERF1 (version 1.2; Alexander et al. 1999), and includes the incremental and total drainage area derived from 1-kilometer (km) elevation data for North America. Previous estimates of the water time-of-travel were recomputed for reaches with water- quality monitoring sites that included two reaches. The mean flow and velocity estimates for these split reaches are based on previous estimation methods (Alexander et al., 1999) and are unchanged in ERF1-2. Drainage area calculations provide data used to estimate the contribution of a given nutrient to the outflow. Data estimates depend on the accuracy of node connectivity. Reaches split at water- quality or pesticide-monitoring sites indicate the source point for estimating the contribution and transport of nutrients and their loads throughout the watersheds. The ERF1-2 coverage extends the earlier ERF1 coverage by providing digital-elevation-model (DEM-based estimates of reach drainage area founded on the 1-kilometer data for North America (Verdin, 1996; Verdin and Jenson, 1996). A 1-kilometer raster grid of ERF1-2 projected to Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area, NAD 27 Datum (Snyder, 1987), was merged with the HYDRO1K flow direction data set (Verdin and Jenson, 1996) to generate a DEM-based watershed grid, ERF1_2WS. The watershed boundaries are maintained in a raster (grid cell) format as well as a vector (polygon) format for subsequent model analysis. Both the coverage, ERF1-2, and the grid, ERF1-2WS are available at: http://water.usgs.gov/lookup/gisgetlist. The version of RF1 used to compile ERF1-2 was an early edition of a USGS RF1 translation and was updated by USEPA (USEPA, 1996).

The Program coordinates the acquisition of lands for the use of all units of DNR. Stateside POS funds are allocated to purchase land for state parks, forests, wildlife habitat, natural, scenic and cultural resources for public use. A portion of stateside funds are also dedicated to capital improvements, critical maintenance, and operations in state parks. Stateside POS projects are now being driven by a new Targeting System, which uses the best scientific information available to target the program's limited funds.

Stream Waders is the volunteer component of the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS).Goals of Stream Waders are: to increase the density of sampling sites for use in stream and watershed assessments; to improve stream stewardship ethics and encourage local action to improve watershed management; to educate the local community about the relationship between land use and stream quality; and to provide quality assured information on stream quality to state, local, and federal agencies, environmental organizations, and others.Stream Waders is designed to be seamless with the MBSS and several other stream sampling programs in Maryland. MBSS samples are collected at the watershed level (8-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC); about 70 square miles each), while Stream Waders volunteers sample at a smaller scale subwatersheds at the 12-digit HUC; about 8 square miles each). Thus, Stream Waders data should help fill the gaps left in watershed areas not sampled by MBSS.

Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses, as well as Maryland's growing coastal population, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized.

The designation will continue for a period of 24 months, during which time local governments will have the opportunity to apply for continued Sustainable Communities designation. Community Legacy Areas designated prior to January 1, 2008 will become Sustainable Community for 24 months after June 1, 2010. Existing Community Legacy Areas designated on or after January 1, 2008 will be considered Sustainable Communities for a period of 36 months after June 1, 2010. An application procedure is being developed for local governments to request continued Sustainable Communities designation beyond the transition period. The Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) will begin accepting applications for Sustainable Communities in the Fall of 2010. Applications for Sustainable Communities designation will be reviewed by an interagency panel led by DHCD and must be approved by the Governor's Smart Growth Subcabinet. Once approved, newly designated Sustainable Communities (those that apply after June 1, 2010) will retain their designation for a period of five years. Sustainable Communities also include designated Transit Oriented Development Zones (TOD's) and Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Zones.

The Natural Capital Project's Coastal Vulnerability model was used to calculate a Shoreline Hazard Index, representing the relative exposure of each segment to storm-induced erosion and flooding. Inputs to the model included 6 physical variables (geomorphology, elevation, sea level rise, wave power, storm surge height and erosion rates) and 5 habitat types (forest, marsh, dune, oyster reef and underwater grass). Two scenarios of the model were run: one scenario incorporating the protective role of all existing coastal habitats and the other scenario simulating the complete loss of habitats. The difference between the two scenarios indicates the potential magnitude of coastal hazard reduction by habitats at each location. Model results were integrated with MD DNR's Community Flood Risk Areas (March, 2016) in order to highlight areas where hazard reduction by habitats is most likely to benefit at-risk coastal communities.This dataset was produced under award number NA13NOS4190136 from the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through the Maryland Department of Natural Resources Chesapeake and Coastal Services (CCS).

To determine areas forested, contiguous areas of tree cover less than 1 acre were removed from the dataset and then used for clipping the stream and shoreline buffers.Feature Service Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Biota/MD_Forests/FeatureServer/1",2016-02-08T19:46:17.000ZZ,2016,[u'ArcGIS Online for Maryland'],b932b63e-ae56-4cbb-be56-6b7d32fb6273,,37.8907 -79.4871 39.723 -79.4871 39.723 -75.0506 37.8907 -75.0506 37.8907 -79.4871,2016,[],b932b63e-ae56-4cbb-be56-6b7d32fb6273,37.8907 -79.4871 39.723 -75.0506,Forests - Forested Buffers: Maryland,Shapefile,"[u'Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, United States', u'Maryland, United States']",Maryland iMap,b932b63e-ae56-4cbb-be56-6b7d32fb6273,Dataset,

These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access, land acquisition, and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses, as well as Maryland's growing coastal population, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.Last Updated: 07/01/2014Feature Service Layer Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Society/MD_RecreationalUses/FeatureServer/37",2016-04-06T16:38:20.000ZZ,2016,[u'ArcGIS Online for Maryland'],a12e9084-ffbf-49d3-b190-9f9aa4733c49,,36.8734 -79.4696 39.7216 -79.4696 39.7216 -72.2816 36.8734 -72.2816 36.8734 -79.4696,2016,[],a12e9084-ffbf-49d3-b190-9f9aa4733c49,36.8734 -79.4696 39.7216 -72.2816,"Recreational Uses - Recreational Motorized Vessel Fishing: Maryland, 2016",Shapefile,"[u'Maryland, United States']",Maryland iMap,a12e9084-ffbf-49d3-b190-9f9aa4733c49,Dataset,

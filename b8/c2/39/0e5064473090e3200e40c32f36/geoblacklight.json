No formal metadata was received, but MGS describes the data as generalized polygon outlines, mostly qualitative assessments of where the thickness of the sand body pinches out to less than 1 meter thickness over the underlying revinement surface. In some cases it is the 60 foot contour, where there is no seismic data.Feature Service Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Geoscientific/MD_OceanShoal/FeatureServer/0",

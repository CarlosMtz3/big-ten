"dc_description_s": "Each of the State of Maryland's 1,406 2010 census tracts was analyzed to determine whether it represented a typical census tract as defined by the U. S. Bureau of the Census. Nationally these are census tracts that optimally are 4,000 inhabitants but generally range from 1,200 to 8,000 persons. In Maryland the average census tract contains 4,106 persons. Nationally the housing unit threshold for each census tract generally ranges from 480 to 3,200 housing units, with an optimum size of 1,600 housing units. In Maryland the average census tract contains 1,692 housing units. The Emergency Management Planning Database and the Emergency Planning Vulnerable Population Index are intended to assist State agency emergency officials plan tactics, develop strategies, allocate resources and prioritize responses for emergencies and to identify potentially vulnerable population areas for special attention. Statewide, there are 222 census tracts containing persons at Very High socio  economic risk or vulnerability in the event of an emergency. Very High risk census tracts account for 16  percent of the State's 1,390 specified census tracts. These census tracts are located throughout the State in 20 of 24 jurisdictions. There are 773,808 persons living in these areas making up 13.4 percent of the State's 2010 Census population of 5,773,552 persons.Feature Service Layer Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/PublicSafety/MD_VeryHighRiskCensusTracts/FeatureServer/0",

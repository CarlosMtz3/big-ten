"dc_description_s": "The City of Chicago launched the Micro-Market Recovery Program (MMRP), a coordinated effort among the City, not-for-profit intermediaries, and non-profit and for-profit capital sources to improve conditions, strengthen property values, and create environments supportive of private investment in targeted markets throughout the city. The goal of MMRP is to improve conditions, strengthen property values, and create environments supportive of private investment in targeted areas by strategically deploying public and private capital and other tools and resources in well-defined micro-markets. This dataset shows the areas covered by the MMRP program. The data can be viewed on the Chicago Data Portal with a web browser. However, to view or use the files outside of a web browser, you will need to use compression software and special GIS software, such as ESRI ArcGIS (shapefile) or Google Earth (KML or KMZ). For more information on the MMRP program, please see http://www.regionalhopi.org/content/city-chicago-micro-market-recovery-program-overview.",

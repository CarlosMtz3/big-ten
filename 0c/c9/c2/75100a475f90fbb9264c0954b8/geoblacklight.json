Sites outside the Critical Area are already owned by a public agency. Coverage is of attributed polygons only; attributes are NHA numbers and names from COMAR 08.03.08, and the USGS 7.5 minute quadrangles upon which the original boundaries were manually drawn.Feature Service Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Biota/MD_LivingResources/FeatureServer/8",

"dc_description_s": "This data layer is a compilation of the MUPOLYGON feature class, muaggatt table and component table of the Gridded Soil Survey Geographic (gSSURGO) Database for Maryland. United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service. Under the direction of the Watershed Resources Registry (WRR) Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) this data has been altered from its original state. A reclassification of the hydric classification field was performed which classifies all soil map units consisting of less that 40% total hydric soils as not hydric, all soil map units from 41% - 79% as partially hydric and all soil map units 80% and greater as hydric. This reclassification was performed to provide a more refined input for modeling purposes. A full version of this database is available at: http://datagateway.nrcs.usda.gov/.Last Updated: 01/15/2014Feature Service Layer Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Geoscientific/MD_Geology/MapServer/2",

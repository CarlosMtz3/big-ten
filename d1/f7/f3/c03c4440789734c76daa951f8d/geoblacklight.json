For analysis purposes Assessment neighborhoods are defined by the environment of a subject property that has a direct and immediate effect on its value. The assessment neighborhood is a geographic area (in which there are typically fewer than several thousand properties) defined for some useful purpose Assessment neighborhoods boundaries typically follow street centerlines The current feature class was created by selecting coincident features from the DC GIS snapbase. These included road centerlines After a new feature class was created001 meters.",

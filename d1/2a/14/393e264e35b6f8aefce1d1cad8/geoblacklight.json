A riparian buffer is an area of vegetation that is maintained along the shore of a water body to protect water quality along with stabilizing stream channels and banks. Buffers can reduce the pollutants entering a stream, lake or pond by filtering and altering the form of sediments, nutrients and other chemicals in runoff from surrounding lands. Pennsylvania has the goal of eventually restoring buffers along all of our streams, lakes and ponds. The project locations that fall within 150 meters of the National Hydrography Network (NHD) have been snapped to the nearest stream location on the NHDFlowline layer. All other project locations are plotted as they are entered.",

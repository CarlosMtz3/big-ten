Changes to the Preliminary boundaries may occur before official map adoption. Use this layer with caution. The effective regulatory floodplain should be used for conducting all official floodplain determinations until such time the preliminary floodplain is reviewed and adopted by FEMA and a given community. It is reasonable to assume that preliminary floodplain boundaries are more accurate than the Q3, but the Q3 may better represent the current regulatory Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) when verified by using the paper FIRM.Last Updated: 03/2016Feature Service Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Hydrology/MD_Floodplain/FeatureServer/0",

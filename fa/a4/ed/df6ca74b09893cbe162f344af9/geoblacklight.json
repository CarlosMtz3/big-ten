The original data set was compiled in the field and interpreted by Joseph F. Whaley. The data set was then transferred into a more modern format (Microsoft Excel spreadsheet) and deciphered using the original code set by Christina James under the guidance of Walter Hasenmueller. Additional editorial checks were made by Karen Like with assistance from Robert F. Blakely. The Indiana Geological Survey employed all of the aforementioned people at the time of service.",

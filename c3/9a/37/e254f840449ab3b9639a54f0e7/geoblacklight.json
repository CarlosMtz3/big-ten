These permits are written to cover various aspects of the mining operations, such as: reclamation, water quality protection, air quality protection, waste disposal and mine subsidence control. The DEP California District Office reviews permits related to Bituminous coal underground mining. Module 6.1 of the Application for Bituminous Underground Mine requires a Location Map be submitted with the permit. The Location Map should be a 7.5 Minute USGS map covering the area within one (1) mile of the underground permit area boundaries. This dataset contains the digitized underground permit area boundaries of the active underground bituminious mines in Pennsylvania based from the Location Maps submitted with the permit applications and permit renewal applications.",

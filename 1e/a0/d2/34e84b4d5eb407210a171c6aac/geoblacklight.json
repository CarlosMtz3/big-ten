Values range from 0 to 100, use of integer rather than decimal values reduced storage volume. Date of the imagery ranged from 1999 to 2002, availability depended on extent of cloud cover at time of acquisition. Most of the imagery were acquired in 2001. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation supported the construction of the impervious surface data, with technical assistance from Eric Warner and Deborah Slawson.",

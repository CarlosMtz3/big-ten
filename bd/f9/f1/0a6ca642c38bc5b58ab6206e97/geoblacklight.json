"dc_description_s": "The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide, continuous survey designed to provide communities with reliable and timely demographic, housing, social and economic data. The ACS replaces the decennial census long form in 2010 and every year thereafter. The annual ACS sample is smaller than that of previous long form surveys resulting in a larger sampling error. Coefficients of Variation (CVs), which are statistical measures that show the relative amount of sampling error associated with an estimate, are presented here as a measure of reliability and usability of the data. The unit of geography used for the 2009 - 2013 data is the ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA). ZCTAs are statistical geographic areas produced by the Census Bureau by aggregating census blocks to create generalized areas closely resembling the U.S. Postal Service's postal ZIP codes.Map Service Link:http://archive.geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Demographics/MD_ArchivedAmericanCommunitySurvey/MapServer/3",

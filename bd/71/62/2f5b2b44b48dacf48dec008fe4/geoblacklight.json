"dc_description_s": "The Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (MALPF), housed within the Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA), protects agricultural lands through the use of perpetual easements. This program was created by the Maryland General Assembly in 1977, is governed by the Agricultural Article, Sections 2-515 through 2-516 of the Annotated Code of Maryland. Described briefly, the process begins with an interested, qualified landowner voluntarily creating a district, containing one or more tracts of land. Easements may then be donated or purchased, protecting in perpetuity the land for agricultural purposes. There is a formal process for obtaining these designations, including the Maryland Board of Public Works approval. These data are intended for general guidance and use only.Last Updated: 05/2014Feature Service Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Environment/MD_ProtectedLands/FeatureServer/4",

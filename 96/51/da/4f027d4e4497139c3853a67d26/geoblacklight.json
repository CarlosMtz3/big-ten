Contours were created from a DTM Feature Dataset, upgraded by Baker and T-3 to support National Mapping Accuracy Standards (NMAS) for contours . Intermediate Contours are contours spaced at 5 foot intervals. Depression Contours are contours showing the edges and slope in a depression at 5 foot intervals. Contours are coded separately for delineation between depression and intermediate contours.",

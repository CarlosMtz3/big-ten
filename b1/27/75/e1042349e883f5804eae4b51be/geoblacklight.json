"dc_description_s": "SW_COAL_ENTRY, the predecessor of COAL_MINE_ENTRIES_IN, is a point- based ESRI ArcView shapefile that shows the locations of underground coal mine entrances in the coal region of Indiana. SW_COAL_ENTRY includes entrance locations of underground mines that operated in Indiana since the mid-1800s. COAL_MINE_ENTRIES_IN is attributed to allow the mine entrances to be differentiated based on entrance type (hoist shaft, other shafts, slope, unknown), depth, mine number, source information (map number), and azimuth (a numeric value between 0 and 360 used in ArcView GIS version 3.2, with the symbol used by COAL_MINE_ENTRIES_IN.avl, to rotate the slope entrance symbols to the approximate orientation of the actual mine entrances).",

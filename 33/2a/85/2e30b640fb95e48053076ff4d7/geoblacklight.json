"dc_description_s": "The DFIRM Database presents the flood risk information depicted on a given Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) in a digital format suitable for use in electronic mapping applications. The DFIRM database is a subset of the Digital Flood Insurance Study (FIS) database that serves to archive the information collected during the FIS. This map service is a composite of Effective and Preliminary floodplain data. Q3 data is used where neither Effective or Preliminary data is available for a given community. The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event, the 0.2-percent-annual- chance flood event, and areas of minimal flood risk. The DFIRM Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data, where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The specifications for the horizontal control of DFIRM data files are consistent with those required for mapping at a scale of 1:12,000.Last Updated: 03/2016Map Service Link: http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Hydrology/MD_Floodplain/FeatureServer",

The source scale of the map depicting the aquifers was 1:500,000. The attribute table for the aquifer system units include aquifer system name, aquifer system type, potential yield in gallons per minute (gpm), total thickness (feet), and a web link to more detailed information. A layer (AQUIFER_SYSTEMS_BEDROCK_IDNR_IN.lyr) file accompanies this data layer to assist the user with symbolization so that the sequence of aquifer systems can be visualized in geographic information system (GIS) software, particularly ESRI software products.",

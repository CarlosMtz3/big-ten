An orthoimage is remotely sensed image data that has been positionally corrected for camera lens distortion, vertical displacement and variations in aircraft altitude and orientation. Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. Flown during leaf off conditions between March 27, 2010 and April 22, 2010. Digital imagery at 1''= 200' design scale natural color aerial photography at 1' pixel resolution. Image tile dimensions are 5000' by 5000' and 1000 tiles cover the entirety of Lehigh and Northampton Counties.",

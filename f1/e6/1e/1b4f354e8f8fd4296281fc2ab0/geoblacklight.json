"dc_description_s": "This raster dataset is a compilation of several data sets that have been combined to create an overall aquatic resources conservation value raster for the High Allegheny Plateau of Pennsylvania. It is one of three groups used to create an overall Conservation Resources data set. Conservation value ranges from 1 - 10 with 10 being the highest value. The following eleven data sets were created through SmartConservation methodology using conservation values determined by experts gathered by Natural Lands Trust. Riparian Buffer Quality - 12% Water Quality (303d/305B) - 11% Headwaters Protection - 12% Impervious Cover 2000 - 11% Impervious Cover Change 1985-2000 - 5% Forested Water Quality - 12% Hydric Soils - 4% Floodplains - 4% National Wetlands Inventory - 5% Fish Habitat - 12% Herp (Aquatic) Habitat - 12% They were added and weighted together and the resulting raster was then reclassified into 10 quantiles as follows: 10 Quantiles (with zero excluded in quantile reclassification) Old Value New Value 0.76 - 4.561562 1 4.561562 - 5.100117 2 5.100117 - 5.416914 3 5.416914 - 5.638672 4 5.638672 - 5.86043 5 5.86043 - 6.113867 6 6.113867 - 6.367305 7 6.367305 - 6.589062 8 6.589062 - 6.969219 9 6.969219 - 8.87 10 NoData NoData The weighted percentages of each data set is shown above.",

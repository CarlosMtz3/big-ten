Interum roof lines, such as dormers, are not shown. Minor structures such as carports, decks, patios, stairs, etc. which are part of the structure are not shown. Buildings less than 400 square feet were not captured. Special consideration was given to garages, less than 400 square feet, and were digitized if greater than 200 square feet. Building Footprints were updated as a result of a County flyover in 2004 , as a result of PAMAP aerial photography in 2006, using 2010 Pictometry Imagery and will be updated on an ongoing basis as new imagery is acquired.",

"dc_description_s": "SUPERFUND_IDEM_IN is a point shapefile that contains GPS-located Superfund Program facility locations in Indiana, provided by personnel of Indiana Department of Environmental Management, Office of Land Quality (IDEM, OLQ) as of August 16, 2002 and subsequently updated on January 14, 2003, July 11, 2003, June 3, 2004, January 4, 2005, April 25, 2005, July 27, 2006, January 24, 2007, June 4, 2009, April 16, 2010, June 25, 2013, and February 25, 2015. The data set provided by IDEM was in an Esri geodatabase format and the feature class was named SUPERFUND. SUPERFUND_IDEM_IN is attributed with facility identifications, federal identification numbers, and addresses. Facility information and locational coordinates for state programs were provided by the Federal Cleanup, Superfund, & NRDA section, Office of Land Quality, Indiana Department of Environmental Management. The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile SUPERFUND: This project is the first phase in the creation of a base locational data set to establish Geographic Information Systems as an integral part of data management for the Superfund program. Envrionmental Project Managers were trained in techniques and proper use of Global Positioning Systems. Trained staff then went into the field and collected GPS information at managed sites. This information was then brought back to the office, processed, and QA/QC'd before being deposited in a central archive.",

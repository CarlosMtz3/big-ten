"dc_description_s": "The digital segmented network based on watershed boundaries, ERF1-2, includes enhancements to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's River Reach File 1 (RF1) (USEPA, 1996; DeWald and others, 1985) to support national and regional-scale surface water-quality modeling. Alexander and others (1999) developed ERF1, which assessed the hydrologic integrity of the digital reach traces and calculated the mean water time-of-travel in river reaches and reservoirs. ERF1-2 serves as the foundation for SPARROW (Spatially Referenced Regressions (of nutrient transport) On Watershed) modeling. Within the context of a Geographic Information System, SPARROW estimates the proportion of watersheds in the conterminous U.S. with outflow concentrations of several nutrients, including total nitrogen and total phosphorus, (Smith, R.A., Schwarz, G.E., and Alexander, R.B., 1997). This version of the network expands on ERF1 (version 1.2; Alexander et al. 1999), and includes the incremental and total drainage area derived from 1-kilometer (km) elevation data for North America. Previous estimates of the water time-of-travel were recomputed for reaches with water- quality monitoring sites that included two reaches. The mean flow and velocity estimates for these split reaches are based on previous estimation methods (Alexander et al., 1999) and are unchanged in ERF1-2. Drainage area calculations provide data used to estimate the contribution of a given nutrient to the outflow. Data estimates depend on the accuracy of node connectivity. Reaches split at water- quality or pesticide-monitoring sites indicate the source point for estimating the contribution and transport of nutrients and their loads throughout the watersheds. The ERF1-2 coverage extends the earlier ERF1 coverage by providing digital-elevation-model (DEM-based estimates of reach drainage area founded on the 1-kilometer data for North America (Verdin, 1996; Verdin and Jenson, 1996). A 1-kilometer raster grid of ERF1-2 projected to Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area, NAD 27 Datum (Snyder, 1987), was merged with the HYDRO1K flow direction data set (Verdin and Jenson, 1996) to generate a DEM-based watershed grid, ERF1_2WS. The watershed boundaries are maintained in a raster (grid cell) format as well as a vector (polygon) format for subsequent model analysis. Both the coverage, ERF1-2, and the grid, ERF1-2WS are available at: http://water.usgs.gov/lookup/gisgetlist. The version of RF1 used to compile ERF1-2 was an early edition of a USGS RF1 translation and was updated by USEPA (USEPA, 1996). The capabilities of the enhanced version of RF1 (ERF1-2) and the current USEPA version have not been evaluated. The user is referred to the USEPA version [http://www.epa.gov/owow/monitoring/rf/rfindex] for discussions of streamflow accuracy and general background on the origin of RF1.Last Updated:Feature Service Layer Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Hydrology/MD_Waterbodies/MapServer/0",

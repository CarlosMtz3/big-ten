Protection is provided through the acquisition of easements and fee estates from willing landowners and the supporting activities of Rural Legacy Sponsors and local governments.This file consists of properties that have been protected using Rural Legacy funds. In the case of a project with multiple parcels, the Identify results will indicate the total acreage and BPW amount for the project. Hence, you will see the same acreage, BPW amount and TEA result for each part of the project.Map Service Link:http://archive.geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Environment/MD_ArchivedProtectedLandsAcquisitions/MapServer/3",

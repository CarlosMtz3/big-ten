Samples were collected on a 1-km grid by the Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) between June 1976 and August 1984.Consider the age of the data (1976-1984), the sampling density (1-km grid) and the spatial and temporal variability of estuarine sediments in evaluating the fitness for use of this data set. Graphic displays and printed tabular listings derived from this data set may be used in publications and presentations, provided that credit is given to the originators of the data set (see Section 1.1).Last Updated:Feature Service Layer Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Geoscientific/MD_Soils/MapServer/9",

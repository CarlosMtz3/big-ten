When possible, efforts were made to confirm the rooftop location of each ambulatory surgery centers. The accuracy of geocoding is available in Geocoding Certainty attribute field (Geocoding Certainty: Rooftop=N00N, Street=N01N, Zip Centroid=N04N, Not geocoded=N99N). Latitude and longitude are recorded in the WGS 1984 coordinate system in decimal degrees. The attribute data were obtained from an annual ambulatory surgery center survey and include approximately 15 fileds such as facility ID number, facility name, street address, etc. Additional fields and data items could be potentially linked to this layer.

The program requires that all land being utilized for wetland banking purposes be protected by a State conservation easement, although other land protection mechanisms were used prior to 2000. These protected lands are primarily privately-owned and not accessible to the public without landowner permission. This spatial data layer shows the approximate boundaries of lands protected by State of Minnesota conservation easements and/or other land protection mechanisms associated with the State's wetland banking program. Information on wetland banking and associated credits can be found at http://bwsr.state.mn.us/wetlands/wetlandbanking/credits.html.",

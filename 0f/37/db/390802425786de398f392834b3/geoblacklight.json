The LiDAR data was collected in April 2008 as NMcHenry Co., IL LiDARN and was Task Order Number: 3. Data was acquired by Quantum Spatial as project 1080208 with an Optech ALTM 3100 sensor equipped with an inertial measuring unit (IMU) and GPS receiver. The acquisition was to produce bare earth ASCII, LAS data and 2 foot contour Shapefiles.",
